# Replica Of Front Page of British Gas Uk Website

Reason for undertaking such a task: The main aim of undertaking such a task was to aid in my development in producing attractive front-end UIs.  I tasked myself to take the front face of the British gas website and see if I could reproduce the site with the skill-set that is presently available to me.

The primary focus was on development in the relatively recent css technologies, namely css grid and flexbox.   I find client-side languages such as JavaScript and back-end languages PHP fairly easy to obtain a degree of competence, insofar as building dynamic websites are concerned.   However,  the bottle neck to my development seems to be mastery of css.  I find the technology very frustrating at times.  Having said that, since finishing this project, I am feeling quite sanguine towards future use with css.  Introducing css Grid seems to truncate a lot of legacy css code (especially when different screen sizes come into the picture).  Flexbox has a similar advantage, however, I think I will use Flexbox sparingly when compared to grid, as grid has more functionality than Flexbox and can can do much of the same tasks as Flexbox. Finally learning and introducing Block Element Modifiers (BEM) techniques to my css code is a game changer.  Css code is now much easier to follow, and amend.  The consequence is that you need to write more css classes however that perceived negative is well worth it when it comes to finding and sorting coding mistakes.  Css code was compartmentalized using the preprocessor SASS for this project. 

Technologies used:  This was specifically just a client side task more concerned with the replication of the presentation rather than the functionality of the British Gas site.  For example web-links are not activated.  Therefore technologies used was; HTML, CSS, SASS(css preprocessor) and  little JavaScript for the drop-down menus.

\f0\fs240 \cf0 Ok my notes on what i need to learn.  Just realised that my masters will not have any utility until i get my code up to scratch.  I looked at a portfolio website templates and the responsiveness nature of the sites looked to be complicated, i wouldn\'92t know where to begin.  Josh was saying that a lot of them use bootstrap for this, but this one in particular seemed to use css media queries with  a few javascript libraries.  Jquery of course, with this thing called block quote i think.  \

\fs194 \

\fs230 I am looking at kevin Powell\'92s tutorial from 2016 on how to make a website totally responsive.  He first designs the site on adobe photoshop and has two designs one for the web site and one for the mobile.  He gave a dropbox link to work with him from scratch.  \

\fs194 \

\fs256 \cf0 The drop box just has the images we are doing the rest.    He said the first and most important step when it comes to making the site responsive is to get this meta tag in:\
\

\fs252 <meta name=\'93viewport\'94 content=\'93width=device-width, initial-scale=1\'94>\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs194 \cf0 \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs244 \cf0 The above meta tag is really important because without it could mean that users see the desktop site just zoomed way way out, rather that the mobile view.  \'93Scales properly\'94 is the term he used. \
\
he said he is going for mobile first and that is the way we should design.\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs238 \cf0 A good tip when beginning to get the design right, he has adobe photoshop opened with the design of the mobile site and codes the html while looking at the design. \
\
I might have to acquaint myself with user experience design (UX).  You have to do everything, especially as a freelance, travis.

\fs244 \cf0 used the emmet package for html shortcuts.  cool.  \
\
\'93mobile space is pretty valuable\'94 kevin powell.  In photoshop where he displays his mock up site he has it contained in a grid set up, i wonder if how he is going to code that very thing in a grid in html?

\fs246 \cf0 can\'92t copy and paste the text because he has given us the jpg image not the original photoshop file.  managed to get the psd file for editing and pasting - it is a T box - A box in gimp.\

\fs248 \cf0 The figure tag is basically a way to make all your images and videos  etc more semantic rather than using, \'91div soup\'94.  It also lets a caption be put into the figure rather than assigning that to a paragraph tag with will small size text.  The fig caption is not needed.  Kevin also is putting comments in with his figures.  There is an aside tag but that is used for non-essential figures.  Figure tag is for essential image items.  \

\fs242 \cf0 a web site i looked at said that graphics should not be put inside figure tags, they should have their own image tags.  The reason for this (yet to understand this but i will take his word for it at this point) is if the user can\'92t see the graphic then not big deal as it doesn\'92t harm the content of the site.

\fs230 \cf0 There was a message that came through his video, saying something that he forgot to do a CTA - which i think stands for a call to action button, like sign me up or something.   Yeah that seems to be the lingo, in websites that are there to make money.  \

\fs244 \cf0 He said something about a six column grid when using photoshop.\
\
He talks about a column system.  I think this could be useful.  He talks about the design of websites saying that the home page is the one that is really unique, the rest of the website pages are more formulaic.  \
\

\fs246 \cf0 this column system seems to be a grid system.  Ok I am beginning to see why he uses classes so much even when it is contained in a relative section like the footer of the header etc.  He uses classes so if he wants to use the same style elsewhere on the site he can.  So for example like under the footer he has three unordered lists.  Now rather than using css like this, footer ul\{ style: here;\}  he wants that to be a separate class like ul.unstlyed-list\{\
style: here;\}\

\fs256 \cf0 cool learned how to import google fonts, you put it in the css file.   \
when you put margin 0 in the css tag it means to get rid of the margins and auto, it doesn\'92t necessarily mean that, but what it means is that the default browser left and right margins will be equal. means to centre the image.  Yeah seems to be the case.\
\
Cause he is doing mobile first, in the body he has text-align: centre;\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs194 \cf0 \

\fs240 he does say that he uses *\{box-sizing: border-box;\} on all of his websites because it takes out the additional size that padding creates, so the padding will be included in the box sizes.  he says that should ve default in css files, but it is not.  He says in his css he likes to use a lot of comments, yeah that seems to be the best practice.  \
\
he is going o be trying ems and rems for everything rather than pixel sizes, the travis boy said that as well, he said it helps with font sizes and margins and padding he has been pretty good with that, but he uses pixels for widths, he is going to try and stop doing that.\

\fs194 \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs236 \cf0 padding on links and buttons is good because for the user it makes the clickable area bigger for them, especially if they are using mobile with their thumbs.\
\
I think i have found out the difference from the rem and the ems.  rem sizes are times the root tag font size, so this would normally be the body tag or the browser default font size which is 16px.  the em sizes are the times size of the parent tag.  \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs260 \cf0 in css remember two values for margin means top and bottom and lefts and right, so:\
\
padding: 10 em 0;  would mean 10em top 10 em bottom none left and right.
\fs194 \
\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs232 \cf0 the header absolute position lets the background image scale to take care of the header.  it makes the text go to the left, the way around that is to make left 0 then right 0 to centre it, oh yeah seen it now, because the absolute position puts it to the corner of the browser page.  Remember he uses left and right rather than margin left and right because they are are positioned elements.    I think in this case the background covers the page because by doing header absolute takes the header out of the flow of the page (yeah if you didn\'92t do that, you would see that the backgoround-size: cover, would just cover the section it was in), in other words its own box separate from the dimensions of the page, therefore the background which is set to relative covers the parent as well, which would be the body element.  I am just guessing here.

Take the time to learn one concept at a time until you can teach each one to someone else with no problems. Work on that one coding skill until it's boring to you. That's how you know you really understand it - good study tip.

\fs238 \cf0 Another guess here is that since the header paren\'92ts tag is the body tag, by making the header absolute it takes the header and all the child tags out of the flow of the page, which would include the nav tags, so the next child tag after the header closes is the section tag and that is why that background takes up the whole page an moves to the top and it also moves to the width dimension to the body tag because there has not been a container set.   \
\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs232 \cf0 maybe when i hit a problem with the responsiveness to fuck about with the position property.  \
\
he does a subtle effect on the hover over the links, pseudo elements, nav a:hover, a:focus\{color: #ddd:\}\
\
ok something you must always do to make your images responsive is to have the img tag set at \{\
\
max-width: 100%;\
height: auto;\
\}\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs250 \cf0 so that the img never goes outside the container it is in, this is likely to happen of the image itself is of a big size.  when coding for mobile first he makes a container that is 95% width \
0 for top and bottom and auto, auto in this regard i think is like 0 for left to right margin.  Auto is for centring. \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs194 \cf0 \

\fs240 always do display block on the span tags so they have there own margins etc, doesn\'92t need to be display block, it could be inline-block, the display block puts a line break on it, hence the difference in the names, I think the penny just dropped.
\fs194 \
\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs232 \cf0 yeah so i saw the rem and the em difference there.  if you want the em\'92s to respond to the parent you have to have the parent set first as an rem.  Maybe not, but it would make sense.  because if you do two rems the second rem goes with the root element and not the parent.\
\
if you don\'92t do inline block for the buttons you will not get the height for the padding it will merge into the text.  Strange.  \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs194 \cf0 \

\fs240 I might need to think about learning some design.  Ok downloaded gimp, practice on that learn some design theory.  Following him, you will sure to pick up some design tactics.  Ok it seems to be that the browser default font is 16px, so when you do media queries with rems what ever the rem is where it be 1 or 20 it all times the 16px default pixel font size.  \

\fs194 \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs242 \cf0 when  he does his media quiuires he groups them together with the original class from the mobile screen, just to understand the different breakpoints at the screen sizes.  \
\
i am starting to see why it is mobile first.  Center everything.  I think he is using vh to make the front cover take the whole page, like make it the home page and then you have to click in to the site to see the rest.  Maybe i am wrong here.  \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs238 \cf0 the rem and em i think are going to confuse me.  He did a media query there with increases the font size to 24px via 1.5 rem, and that made the corresponding padding of ems align with the change in rem font size.  So i guess that is kind of cool.\
\
ok video 3, \'93who we are?\'94

\fs242 \cf0 the viewport height and the width is the screen width.  It is good to bear in mind because if you do a 100% width it will only go a 100% of the parent and if they have margins set it won\'92t go to whole width of the screen, whereas the vh will go straight to the screen.  \
\
another great tip there.  Use outline instead of borders, because with outlines you can bring them in or widen them with the page.  Again i don\'92t know if this is true but it seems with the heading tags the  bolder font weight gets selected first by default from the ones you downloaded like 900.   I guess each class has its default weights.   \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs246 \cf0 relative and absolute i think this is really important.  absoutle will be absolute to the browser page, so takes out the flow.  However when the position of the parent is set to relative and then you do position absolute with the child, the posisition is only absoutle to the constraints of that box that has been set to relative.  So it gets taken out of the flow of the browser but is in the min flow of the box that has been set to relative that box but stays in it, sort of like a mini browser in a sense.    lets understand this more. 
\fs194  \
\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs240 \cf0 Ok it can be confusing, but i think i have a hand in it.  The relative position keeps the structure of the layout but does let the box move around that structured layout.  The absolute does not, the absolute goes to the margins of the parent and changes the layout.
\fs194 \

\fs238 \cf0 keep forgetting the default is mobile sizes.  So heavier sizes as you go up.  \
\
i think the strategy is to split the screen into sections and do the media queries from there.  When you do higher font sizes  as you up in screens you need less margin top with more padding left and right.  \
\
it is possible to use adobe xd for website creation. \
\
Ok so getting to the bigger screens now.  A good tip he 
\fs234 uses is that the code that will stay the same gets deleted in media queries - i never said that right.  What i mean here is that you don\'92t need to replicate the code from the original design if there is no changes, all you need to do in the media queries is put in the css that is to change, i never done that so no wonder that confused me. DRY.\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs222 \cf0 if the image is a big image and your container is only seeing part of it, you can use padding to get the rest of it into view. 
\fs194 \

\fs246 \cf0 Ok i think i see the difference between margin top and just the top.  The top is a position with how the element is positioned like relative, absolute etc.  margin top is when the text begins i think, whereas top, begins at the edge of the box. Yep that is correct. \
\
Yeah that was interesting, this will confuse me no doubt but i think i have a hand in it.  It all comes down to the positioning, i think if i get an understanding on that, i can move forward with confidence.  So what i mean here if the element you are doing margin top on has the position: relative set it means when you do an especially negative margin top it will also move the div you are relative too.   
\fs244 lets try this again.  \
\
yeah i don\'92t know if that is correct what i said, i just think it is a difference between top and margin top.  top will move just the positioned element, margin top will move the elements that it is related to (the parents) especially if it is a negative margin.  Interesting.   \
\
On the other hand if use just the top property it moves just the child box (the box you are using) even if it is called relative, same with absolute psortionin, so yeah it seems top is a portion property.  Another way to not use the z-index property.  \

\fs244 \cf0 red green blue alpha - RGBA function.  As the name suggests the first argument is red, second green, third blue and the fourth is the opacity, the less opacity the more transparent it is.   To make other colours you have to merge the primary colours to make this happen.  \
\
he has researched eye drops and positioning as well, \'93your eye drops to there, you eye drops to there etc\'94/ .  Oh yeah i have observed when playing the xbox that PES uses this technique in its home screen.  In that it gives a brief glimpse of the image down below to let the user know that the menu system is not done, there is extra information down below.

\fs252 \cf0 that last bit was helpful, he said he tried a ton of stuff to make it work with the padding and in the end decided it wasn\'92t worth it.  lets try it.

\fs236 \cf0 max width, the value of the max width overrides the width property, if the content or element is wider that the max width the height of the box will get larger to maintain the width, that is if the image size is big enough to do this as it may be already at the maximise height.  Images i think are going to be cunts.    \
\
is the max width setting more responsive that the width property?\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs194 \cf0 \
answer yes it is.  The key word here is the max part.  if the browser spans more than the width of the element the browser continues with the rest of the elements but the element with the max width stops at its maximise width.   Here is a perfect summation of it:  \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f6\b\fs126 \cf7 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
if width > max-width; let the browser use max-width.\cb1 \
\cb3 if width < max-width; let the browser use width.\
\
That is a great description - meaning if the container is 500px wide but the browser spans 600px then the container will stop at 500px\
\
whereas if the browser is 400px wide then it will use that rather than the max of 500px.\

\f0\b0\fs238 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Also with the property value of auto is when you leave it up to the browser to balance the space of the container.  For example if you have height left to auto, i think it enables more responsiveness, as the screen gets less, the height remains to fit into the space left.  \
\
margin bottom, think underneath the element the space moves away and margin top is when the space above the text moves away. \

display inline block: i think it is as the name suggests instead of having a square block, it becomes are more rectangle block.  \

\f3\fs160 \cf4 \cb3 \'a0does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.\

ah yes that is it.  the difference is not a rectangle but that we can have text beside the block, whereas display block will put side element text up above.

That was a very interesting youtube video from code foundary.   Basically, he said to do a project that manages bugs and have log in authentication tracking bugs with a software design pattern like MVC.  He said to use asp.net with c# can\'92t think of why yet oh yeah and he said to do your code in sets of sprints.  Like log in get done today, etc etc. \
\
The other video mentions that to begin thinking like a programmer begins by mastering algorithms.  The programming language is merely the tool to execute the algorithm.  \
\
:focus pseudo class is after a click really.  \
\
outline is actually supposed to be outside the borders, but you can move it inside, maybe that is a hack because i don\'92t think you are supposed to.  \
\
translateX here the x is for horizontal, it is the Y for vertical.  option command I for developer mode on mac.  \
\
ok this transform: translateX(-50%) pish is a little Hacky. But from what i understand it is basically again to do with the position: relative, or absolute settings.  I say tis because the left and right properties of the position element moves from the left hand corner of the element which means it will not be visually centred.  So i just tried margin-left there to see if that would work but no it doesn\'92t.   So you need a hack to get it centred.  basically, you do left: 50% which visually makes it look too much to the right side so to bring in back on the x axis you do this hack of transform: translateX(-50%);\
\
transoform as a property basically allows you to move the container in a weird way.  \
\
background-colour: transparent is like the white colour.  almost with all images you are looking at not repeating them.  \
\

\fs230 ok multiple classes in css i think works like this:  I think the best way is to do it like a button.  if you have button class= \'93button button-form button-form-small\'94  right so if you put all the css design into the button class all the buttons will be designed like this in the html.  Right but if use the second class you inherit all the properties of the first button plus the extra little changes you want to do for the form buttons and finally the last class inherits the properties of the previous two plus the little changes you want to do for small buttons, again though you have to watch the order if you do button-small class before the button class change you will not see the extra style difference for the small buttons.  \

\fs194 \
One thing that is apparent is that the last entry in the css order takes precedence.    \
\
I think this helps with consistency of design with little subtle changes.  \
\

\fs236 \cf0 got to watch for the flow of the page in css.  If you do a media query change to a class check what comes first especially if it is multiple classes.  The media queries i thought would work seperately from the order of the css but no.  I also thought the media queries would be taken after the default code but no.  Yeah iI think it is as simple as whatever comes last is the one that gets picked by the browser, i was thinking because it was media quires they would be excluded from the flow of the page but no, if the media query comes after the class change then that will take precedence rather than the class before it.  So:\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs194 \cf0 \
.button-small\{\
font-size: .7rem; \
\}\
\
will be superseceeded by\'94\
\
@media (min-width:60rem) \{\
\
.button\{\
font-size: 1.5rem;\
\}\
\}\
\
this would win.  The only way around that without changing the structure would be to add back the .button-small class size in the media query.\
\
this was confusing on the user- stylesheet section they were using margin-block-start instead of margin top.  When it is normally horizontal writing style they mean the same thing, but when you change to vertical writing style the margin-block-start seems to equal margin right lol.  Anyway for now just go with the default:\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f7\fs122 \cf8 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
margin-block-start = margin-top\
margin-block-end = margin-bottom\
margin-inline-start = margin-left\
margin-inline-end = margin-right\

\fs228 \cf0 Oh yeah in case i confuse myself this applies the figure tag it has a default left and right margins that is why your image\'92s width will not span the whole page.  Yeah I did the change and the image did go to the end of the screen, however when you increase the screen size the image stops spanning the width of the page.  I wondered why that was the case, so i change max-width to width and yes it did span the whole page but you could see the quality of the image was poor, which gave a hint that the image shouldn\'92t be that size.  So it seems a great design technique is to make all the images the same size in the design suite like photoshop and adobe XD before going to the browser.  I am just going to check the image size now.  \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs194 \cf0 \
Found the answer to the max-width images sizes, kevin makes them all the same size before adding them to the html and the css.  \
\
So now i have to learn this fuck.  \
\
Ok i think i understand why he did what he did.  When he used the design tool photoshop, to maintain that design when going live with the created site, he had to make the images strict sizes to have a chance at the rendered site to be the same as the design.  I think that is what has happened.\

\f4\fs31\fsmilli15750 \cf5 \cb6 :last-of-type
\f3\fs30 \cf4 \cb3 \'a0selector matches every element that is the last child, of a particular type, of its parent.\

\f0\fs194 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 In this case it was the paragraph element, more specifically the second paragraph.  \
\
the background colour usually spans the whole page the whole element at least. \
\
remember when you do a positioning  in the element you can use both the left and right prosperities and also the margin properities.  \
\
for the transform property of the translateX(-50%) the caveat is that you have to do the position of the left property left:50%; first.  \
\
we are at the place where Kevin is wanting to put the button details inside the images with the mobile size.  the first thing he does is make the figers position relative, this is to move the the child elements inside i think by making them absolute.  The figures  also have the default margins taken out with margin 0.\
\
use the rgba for opacity for the background.  You can use background colours to see the inside element box to get a visual image of what is happening, this will be quite a useful debugging tool.  \
\
the img default positioning is inline block to have the images side by side, so when it is a mobile screen there will always be a space because there is no line break with display inline block, so for mobile screen change that to display block and that margin will go away.  I thought the inline block would do that side by side automatically, but it seems not.    \
\
when we go to the bigger screen sizes we don\'92t really need the max width property in the containers, just the images really.  \
\
i thought that by putting the images back to display inline-block that the images would be displayed side by side in the bigger screen.  That didn\'92t happen, i do not know why, maybe something to do with the parent element or also could be to do with the relative positioning of the images, who knows.  In fact i will fuck about with the chrome dev tools.  \
\
Yeah fucked about with them but no it seems display block with float left is what makes it like the li item inline block.  \
\
I kind of got confused with what he was doing there and then i worked it out.  I put overflow: hidden with the parent tag, expecting the figure caption info to disappear.  It didn\'92t.  It only disappeared when he moves the y axis down with the transform property.  I realised why that is.  It is because he created an artificial overflow to make it disappear and then with the hover effect he makes it reappear with making no overflow in the y axis with transform: translateY(0%) axis thus creating no overflow and therefore nothing to be hidden.  \
\
another new thing to get used to there is that you can hover child elements within the parent tag.  First you have to select the parent tag and then in the same line you tell the parent tag that the child element will appear when the hover event occurs.  It is written like this.\
\
.parent-element:hover .childelement\{\
\
*this only works because you have taken the overflow out by using the transform:traslateY(0%);\
\
\}\
  remember to see this working we have to come out of the responsive view from google dev tools.  \
\
The images seem to be where i am going to get most of my problems, it left gaps because the images at the margins because the max width property was set and the subsequent image was lower than the size of the width of the page.  To get around this when it comes into bigger screens you either swap the image for a bigger image or to scale the image upwards with the width: 100% property 0r 100% VW.  Doing it the latter means a compromise on image quality must be allowed.  Let me fuck about with the paddings here or the margins.    I will do that when i come back next.  \
\
background-size: cover;  this property gets the image to span the whole of the container.  \
\
Kevin likes to have a transition the same for everything on the site so he puts it where the star is to select every element.  that transition property is cool.  I will look into it now.  \

this video is back in 2016, he says he now uses flex box and css grid, which i will look into later.  I was viewing a video while playing games, it seems that with the grid it is all done is the display property and that it is done by lines rather than col-1 col-2 etc.  Internet explorer can\'92t use grid.    \
\
\
so far the transition seems to work with the hover effect, i took it out and the hover effect was very quick. It seems to just be for buttons though.   \
\
he def knows a lot about design, he keeps the buttons on the images in lower screen sizes to let the user know that these images are clickable.  \
\
aww i noticed in the comments the image problem was highlighted with the white space, the boys either did my solution or the 100% vw solution.  I am part of something yeah lol.\
\
kevin explained that this happened because his debugging browser screen is only 1080px so didn\'92t notice this.  \
\
I need to investigate the clear fix property.  It seems if you use a float, with a previous element, you need to clear it for the margins to work for the next element.  \
\
w3 schools calls it a \'93hack\'94.  the after:: pseudo element seems to be the key to clear the float.  It seems that you highlight the parent tag, which would be the sections, so when the sections end you clear the floats with the after pseudo element, if of course there are any floats made.\
\
I think it works like this:\
\
remember commas to include multiple classes and tags.  \
\
.clearfix::after,\
section::after\{\
\
content:\'94\'94;\
display:block;\
clear: both;\
\
\}\
\
\
*the after has two colons, didn\'92t expect that., yeah this is the case for pseudo elements*\
\
\
the class clearfix is made just in case you need it for later, you just wrap it in a div i think.\
\
Oh yeah just one point as i was watching the videos last night, the tutorials are just one way to do it, not the way, they are just giving an example of how it is implemented.\
\
Oh yeah do not jump on one technology and assume it is the panacea to all developers problems.  This is very rare, leave yourself open to all possibilities which a strong basic foundation of programming principles.  \
\
clear: both means no floating elements on both sides the left and the right.  \
\
the margin top at portfolio is fine with big screen sizes but needs tightened in the smaller sizes which i will sort when i get back.  I wonder if padding top would sort that out for all screen sizes.  See the way I am visualising that is the box lets say for the header tag would get bigger moving the text down without moving the position on the page with margins.  Something to think about, maybe fuck about with when i can be arsed.   maybe try this now.\
\
Tried it, in this case it looks like i was right with the margin move.  I will try background colour to see the box difference.  Yeah it seems to play in the way I visualise it, the box gets bigger with padding and therefore moves the text without changing the margins.       \
  \
read again the notes on what supersedes what in the order of the css. Oh yeah this is a big problem for me.   With trying to find the order with css, just remember the last entry takes precedence.\
\
Kevin says he likes to have tight margins because then he can control the gaps with padding then rather than margins.  so tight margins in this case means little distance between the margins.  That is what I was just thinking, interesting.   \
\
Careful with the media queries, watch the copy and paste.  I might change my class tags.  he had \'93.title\'94 which was  the H1 element for the title but i had no idea.  I think it will be easier to follow to do this, \'91h1.title\'92 so i know it is a h1 class.  \

\fs218 \cf0 ok recap and experiments with the order again.  Ok i think this will be a forever problem, but i can experiment with movement and see what happens, but for now assume the last entry takes precedent.  At least with the move the buttons stay small in the small screen.  \

\f0\fs194 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Something just hit me there, the reason the media quires overrides the button small is because they both had the font size property, and the way it was done originally meant the media query took precedent because it was the last entry, so it\'92s bigger font size won at the bigger screen size but was still small on mobile first!!

\f0\fs194 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 While it may seem that I am pondering on this here, travis said that is the way to go, as you have to understand it so you can move on and don\'92t need to memorise it.  \
\
So there are many rules to consider here, with many different sites and diagrams that developers use for aids.  \
\
What i have taken from this is that the last entry takes precedent and the !important takes precedent most of all, but that is considered a hack.  \
\
We are on to the footer, where Kevin is creating a bit of a grid system, he is putting at the top under the clear fix hack and before the typography. \
\
He says putting the col inside [square brackets means an attribute]\
\
\
He begins that he wants all columns in his grid system floating to the left.  So a nice easy way to do this is to use an attribute selector.  which is css is the square brackets much like a literal array in javascript.  [].\
\
I think doing it this way is in place of lisiting all the col classes with commas like this:\
\
.col-1, .col-2, .col-3 etc\{\
\
\}\
\
this is the shorthand way\
\
[class^=col-] \{\
\
float:left;\
\
\}  \

\fs222 \cf0 Lets see how this plays out in the browser under inspect.  If you do a change and you don\'92t see the content or it disappeared check your clear fix clearing the floats.  assume that if you create a float you have to clear it as well.  \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs224 \cf0 to facilitate easy readability highlight all and press the tab key, to make the markup look like a tree.  I am beginning to see the advantage of coding for mobile first.  In the body tag he has text-aline centre for mobile users, so when the screen gets bigger all he needs to do is use the selector to align the text left.  \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs232 \cf0 I have noticed that he doesn\'92t do it in the child element like the paragraph elements but instead uses the parent elements so the typography hardly changes, so like the footer tag is used and the selection tag etc.   So maybe consider using the padding solution in the parent tag rather than the child tags

A pseudo-element is a \'91fake\'92 element, it isn\'92t really in the document with the \'91real\'92 ones. Pseudo-classes are like \'91fake\'92 classes that are applied to elements under certain conditions, much like how you would manipulate the classes of elements using JavaScript.

\fs232 \cf0 use padding instead of margins, margins moves the text by moving away rom the element above and below, padding doesn\'92t, it just increases the box in which the content is set at the same time moving the text, use background colour to see what is going on.  \

\f7\fs104 \cb1 margin
\f2\fs108 \cb3 \'a0is the space outside the border
\f0\fs194 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \
\
this is quite a good difference in understanding here:\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa300\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs100 \cf8 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Margin is applied to the\'a0
\f8\b outside
\f2\b0 \'a0of you element hence effecting how far your element is away from other elements.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa300\partightenfactor0
\cf8 \cb1 \uc0\u8232 \cb3 Padding is applied to the\'a0
\f8\b inside
\f2\b0 \'a0of your element hence effecting how far your element's content is away from the border.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs104 \cf8 Also, using margin will not affect your element's dimensions whereas padding will make your elements dimensions (set height + padding) so for example if you have a 100x100px div with a 5 px padding, your div will actually be 105x105px\

\f0\fs194 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 In fact there a few people questioning the last paragraph above, they say this would only happen if the width was applied to auto, however if it is set width this would not happen.  Also i think the box-sizing: border-box; would take care of this.   \

Padding allows the developer to maintain space between the text and it's enclosing element. Margin is the space that the element maintains with another element of the parent DOM.\

\f0\fs194 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Moving on.  \
\
I am just looking at a video that Kevin says we can host our website for free.  \
\
it is GitHub again and metlife- i think we can use this for the portfolio pages but not the project pages.  Static websites.  Next.  \
\
Ok on to flex box.  First we are going to look at a flex container and then the items themselves inside the flex container.  \
\
he says:\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs106 \cf10 \cb11 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Flexbox has pretty much replaced floats and clears, but there are *a lot* of properties to figure out when you're using it! \
\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs194 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 First you begin with display flex the default is flex direction rows.  So it makes the container like a table row and the items inside are like columns of that row/container.  \
\
if you do flex-direction: row-reverse it makes the columns to the right exactly the same way as float right.  \
\
so instead of list item 1 to 5 from left to right, it becomes 1 to 5 from right to left.  \
\
if you change the flex direction to column it goes back to the old way of displaying like display block, elements stack on top of one another.  Strangely enough, the way I think about it is when you make flex-direction row, the list items in the container become columns of that row and if you make flex-direction column, the list items inside become Rows.  \
\
I am beginning to see the power already.  It seems to be more responsive thinking this flex thing.  It helps when it gets to media quires because for our nav we can have the nav links in a flex box direction of row and then for mobile we change to flex box direction column or vice versa until i work out the syntax.  \
\
ok the first little challenge i think i am going to get with this is the width, how do i tell about the width?  The second challenge is  the default is no-rap but when you change it to wrap is puts the boxes into the container the way it sees fit, so if it can\'92t fit it through rows it will then try columns and the smaller you make it, it eventually gets so wrapped that it ends up being bigger than the container which is a pain in the butt, i only think that is true with no-wrap.\
\
Version 2 will hopefully fix that.  yeah the width is going to be the challenge, however before i jump the gun I noticed there is no width put on the items section.  \
\
the no wrap default means that the inside childs do spill out the side which Kevein finds very annoying, so do i.  \
\
I like the wrap so far.  \
\
the width with flex seems to be a max-width to keep for spilling out the container.  for example if you do 25% width but with no wrap it will just rubber your width, you have to make it wrap and at the same time if you make it 1000px which means it will spoil out the container it doesn\'92t do this with wrap i think.  It does spill out with no-wrap but with not the 1000px you expected.    \
\
flex-flow is just a shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap.\
\
the justify content various properties is working on the premise of what the flex direction is.  You can centre the items, you can move them to the right, or the left you can have the first and the last child right at the corner of the page with the items inside spaced equally from one-another, you can also have an equal spacing from the margin left and right as well with the items.  \
\
this works differently when you make it a column flex direction.  it would do all the same as above except from top down.  so like the y and the x axis I think that is called the main axis and something else.  x horizontal, Y vertical.\
\
*remember to get the images from google dev tools*  \
\
the align items works the opposite of the justify content axis.  So if the flex directions is set to row, justify will work horizontally, whereas the align axis will work vertically the opposite is true if the flex direction is set to column.\
\
there is a little hack to get the child elements right in the centre of the container is to centre the justify-content property and centre the align axis property.  \
\
Kevin basically says fuck about with each one until you get the desired effect lol.  Confusing man. \
\
the align-items: baseline helps to align all the child elements if one of the elements is adifferent size, whereas if you do align-items: flex-start, one of the boxes will differ in margins.  \
\
x axis up and down, y axis left to right.  \
\
the align-content property is similar to the justify content property and seems to supersede align-items property only if you have multiple items to choose from, if for example you only have 5 items then this property is not going to do anything.  \
\
\
Kevein says with align content you need multiple lines of content whereas align items works on an individual basis.  \
\
essentially he concludes to play around with this stuff and to use a flex box playground which he said he enclosed a link for but it doesn\'92t work  now.  Investigate further.  In short conclusion, these are all the flex contianers properties, i think i prefer the flex list items properties.  Which we got on to now.  \
\
On to video number 2.  \
\
flex items everything inside a flex box.  As soon as we say to a container - display: flex, everything inside that container becomes a flex item.  I was thinking this will be the new way of doing things, however, maybe you can use it as a hybrid with legacy css.   \
\
five new properties inside the flex items - flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, order and align self - which he says is really  awesome.  There is also just flex  - flex is a shorthand for the three flex stuffs i would assume.  I was right hooray. \
\
watch for the space in the classes in the html markup it means there is potential to style things differently i.e they can all have the item class with their individual, \'91one\'92, \'92two\'92 and \'91three\'92 class. \
\
unitless numbers - what does that mean?  \
I think it is the same as dimensionless numbers which means they are not used for adding or subtracting or number data but rather meaning what a property will do by the number attached to it.   \
\
it does seem to be that is the strength of this technology is the when the screen gets smaller, even without setting a max-width on the elements it will still try its best to shrink the width to accomade for the lack of real-estate in the screen.  \
\
This is interesting.  Say you set the width of all three list items to 250px but there seems to be available space in the container, if you do flex-grow: 1 on one of the list items that list item will grow to meet the real estate space left.  Interesting.  \
\
the flex-grow unitless numbers comes into effect when there are more items so if two of your items are set to flex grow: 1 but the last item is set to flex-grow: 2 or 3 is that when the screen gets larger the item with the higher unit number under flex grow, grows at an accerlated rate compared to the other two.\
\
in reverse the flex shrink with the higher unit number means that as the screen gets smaller it will shrink at a much faster rate than the other two.  Wow.  \
\
and if you put the flex-grow back to 0 it means the width will be default when the screen changes if it has the necessary screen width to accomante the container.  So when it hets small the width basis doesn\'92t apply. \
\
if you just use the flex shorthand in the flex items:  the default of flex shrink will, be 1 i thought it would have been 0 but no.  \
\
yeah the flex self i think means that one of your items can flex the way it fucking wants.  So for example if you have flex start in the container but with item 2 you have flex-self: flex end, then the item one and three will be flex start, top of the x axis whereas item two will be bottom of x axis.  \
\
if you take the align-items off, the default becomes stretch but not for the align self because it has flex-end.  \
\
the order property means you can actually manipulate the order of the html with the flex items you can use order 1 and say you are placed two in the html it will move you to three in the html mark up providing the other childs do not have an order in them.  \
\
he said you might ask yourself why would i use this, kevin then says you might want to use this when going from a mobile screen size to a bigger screen to might want to change the order of the elements.  Cool.\
\
he said you may not want to rely on the negative numbers to move the list items to the left, you could do flex-direction: row-revers and then order the numbers from there. \
\
On the video 3.  \
\
moving into a more real life example here with flex with kevin. \
\

linear gradient might be useful - so many techniques to do the same thing.\
\
\
just taking a quick look at his background-blend-mode.\
\
height and width 100 viewport.  Ok i never thought of this, a good tip Kevin gives is when using a background-image, also to do a background-colour as well.  Even though you can\'92t see the background colour because the image is on top of it, this is a contingency method incase the image doesn\'92t load for whatever reason.  \
\
also put background-size to cover so if you are using a large image it will scale down and show the whole image you downloaded to fit the screen for whatever screen size.  Lets download an image right now.\
\
There is another reason he is doing this, to get the blending property to work you need the image and the background colour.  He said to play around with it to get the look you are after.  \
\
play around with it seems to be the idea, because some blended images will give weird results depending on what image you are using.  \
\
for background images to span the whole container you have to use css, inline images are in the html.  \
\
when you see the image beginning to get used again this means it is in repeat mode. \
\
ok the way kevin describes it with the background image, is that the browser by default is not really caring what the image looks like, just that it does the same job that a background colour does - it fills in the background.  If you want the image to look better that is up to you.  \
\
again he said something i didn\'92t think was true, he said that some designers like to repeat images to create a pattern effect.  I don\'92t know if i will try that one.  \
\
subtle patters is one such site he recommends to develop this phenomenon.  \
\
background cover we do lose a little bit of the image.  \
\
he loves background-size: cover;\
\
background-position: centre; is putting the centre of the image into the centre of the div.  The default is top left to right.  \
\
if you are using background pictures, padding gives you more background.  Lets try this with a background cover on the body element.  \
\
The way to think about it is, if i need more picture on the top I will add more padding on the bottom.  \
\
that is a great tip try and remember this - if you use a background image to cover the whole page you might notice that when the image shrinks the object at the centre that you want to showcase gets lost, so a way around this is to play with the padding to get the object back in the centre of the page again at the smaller screen sizes.  \
\
Next time, find out how to use unsplash, it seems kevin uses a random unsplash image for his mock-up sites. \
\
just fucking about with some chrome dev tools on other sites, it seems the power of images can do all the shadows for you, it you do it in an image editor before moving to the development stage.  Design in photoshop and just add to html it seems.  Like the shadows and all that I mean.  \
\
ok maybe i have to watch the video to understand this unsplash url from Kevin.  \
\
Doh I think i see the value of code pen now lol.  The code is there for you, you can follow along, rather than using your desktop editor, use his code pen and change it accordingly.  Still a bit pissed at the background url using a website address with just a double backslash and it goes to the unsplash site.  \
\
however it seems that the browser is smart enough to convert that into a web address as i did bbc.com into google and google took me to bbc\'92s homepage without me typing in the full url.  \
\
ah i think the variable stuff like $white he uses is sass.  he didn\'92t tell us this, naughty boy.  \
\
again i think he sets flex box as the precedent with a grid layout as a fall back incase flex doesn\'92t work.  this looks very interesting:\

Yup! The grid is amazing, but flexbox still has a place. I find that a lot of the time I create my grid, then have the cells in the grid be flex.\
\
Plus, Grid support isn't amazing yet, so you'll need a fallback with flexbox anyway...

vh is better than percentages when setting an image height as kevin says here:\

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs78 \cf10 \cb11 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
CSS can be insanely complicated and finicky for something with such a basic syntax!\
For your layout, having two containers is a but redundant. I'd delete the outer one, take the 'flex: 1" off the inner one, and give it a min-height: 100vh;\
Heights in percentages don't work (well, they can, but since its one of those "it depends" things, I avoid them most of the time).

He is going to be using sass for this series.  He says it is a preprocessor  which i need to find out what this means.  He says it needs to be complied into css to render on the browser. \
\
The parlance seems to be syntax sugar.  \
\
this boy\'92s definition of a preprocessor is that it is a additional step before the browser computes the css, that is probably where the, \'91pre\'92 comes into it.  There is typically another layer, like a language on top of css.  \
\
The way i am thinking about it that you write in a different way but it will change it to css when it gets rendered by the browser. \
\
The main reason seems to be the syntax sugar.  In that you can use other program styles like variables, nesting, mixin, vendor prefixes etc as sass then with that it will convert the proper order to normal css.  \
\
Right, i see, rather than with CSS where you use the same theme colour time and time again, you can put this detail into a variable at the beginning of the stylesheet and then when you want to refer to the colour throughout your css document you use the variable instead.  \
\
this way the code becomes more readable but also more flexible and more maintainable.  the nested code that sass provides i think is to mirror the html dom tree.  Write them more concisely.  \
\
mixins are supposed to follow the DRY principle, do not repeat yourself.  \
\
accent colour definition seems to be additiantial colours, not the dominant colours but ones you use sparingly to breath new life into the dominant colour.  It is to make the website interesting.  For example the dominant colour is black and the accent colour is orange, the accent colours may be used to focus the eye and to bring the site to life.   \
\
the difference between a mixin and a variable in sass is that the variable will store one piece of information, but the mixing will display a lot of information.  \
\
I wonder if this is like an object that stores the variables in it, so you just refer to the mixin to truncate the repeated lines of code you need to write.  \
\
the invention of preproceessors and their need and their popularity is when DRY and SR is missing from a technology or a language and there is no way to change that at the moment until new versions come out then you can provide a preproccesor until that happens.  \
\
the def i guessed at was not far of, mixin\'92s are like variable on steroids lol.  \
\
the analogy this gay boy came up with is mixing the reusable code in to make one big recipe.  \
\
@mixin is the scss syntax\
\
= is the sass syntax for a mixin\
\
he said a typical css property that you would use a mixin for would be  the border-radius property because you have to put in many vendors prefixs to render well on all browsers.  You will use this all the time so stick it into a mixin.\
yeah it is like a function, or an object in javascript, as you able to put an argument into a parameter.  \
\
Cool all recapped to here.  \
\
here is a syntax of a typical sass mixin:\
\
either @mixin or =border-radius($radius)\
-webkit-border-radius:$radius\
-ms-border-radius:$radius\
border-radius:$radius\
\
so that is the set of of the mixin.  To call it in the css you just do this\
\
\
div\{\
\
background: red; - don\'92t need this with sass.\
+border-radius(10px) - that is how you call it with the plus sign. \
\
\
find out about nesting with a preprosser with css when i come back.  I have a vague idea of the nesting with the preprossoer, but the syntax i need to get use to.  \
\
\
so  i imagine it replaces this:\
\
header\{\
\
properties\
\
\}\
\
access the header p\
\
header p\{\
\
properties\
\
\}\
\
vs nesting:\
\
header\{\
properties\
\
p (which would be the header p)\{\
\
properties\
\
a (which would be the header p a properties)\{\
\
properties \
\
\}\
\}\
\}\
\
yeah i was right - great I can move on now.   \
ok this boy says that nesting in sass helps you structure your css the same way as the html.  This might be very helpful.  \
\
the article tag is nothing special really, just when there is a blog post to write of a form fill or a newspaper story.  It is for a more semantic reading for the search engine spiders.  \
\
Back To Kevin\'92s video on building an application from the ground up with sass.  \
\
\
He says we can use the command line to get sass into our applications, but instead of that he is going to use a outside software to do this called : PREPROSE - i think.\
\
what is does is that it complies sass and uses an auto prefixer so you don\'92t have to worry about vendor prefixes which is awesome.  it has an auto refresh so when you save your page it automatically refreshes the browser.  \
\
He thinks code kit can do the same thing, but he prefers this because it is available on pc and Mac, the others are usually just available on mac.  \
\
he uses flex box now to replace floats.  Jquery is in this project too.  \
\
the gitignore thing is to tell git what you are using so it can ignore other shit that you don\'92t need.  Like if you are on a mac, it will ignore the set up for widows because it is pointless to have that. \
\
I will try and follow along with git as well.   \
\
preprosser - pre - before processing.  \
\
he will explain his file structure and naming convention.  In GitHub you tell it to ignore Sass, i don\'92t know why.  I will find this out.  \
\
Ok i think it is all about version control.  If you are updating new versions in working with a software team, then you want to ignore files that are already complied and complete, like an outside software for example like sass.  This would be under the definition that is not necessary to put things on a server.   Yeah that would be a point, also you may want things private as well and not put on a server.   \
\
On the subject of privacy, \'91on the world wide web\'92 for everyone to see.  \
\
Reasons to use gitignore are one, files that are not necessary to run the application.  So sass in not necessary?  Because it is a preprossoer then maybe it is not necessary because it has to be converted to css to run, so css is necessary but sass probably not.  I guess that applies to all preprossosers   Hmm.\
\
on the mac a .ds.store is a hidden file.  If it has a full stop before it, it means it is meant to be hidden.  ds store is just like a database for the folders.  The windows equivalent is thumb.db.\
\
These are unnecessary files, there just for personal storing basically.  We don\'92t need to pass these files to the cloud, we don\'92t need to share these files with our comrades, this is something we do not need to do.  \
\
There are some files where it will have your username and password, for obvious reasons you don\'92t want to upload these files.  \
\
\
\
I am going to learn the terminal on mac, i just feel i should. \
\
right lets crack on, a fello cone heed like me is going to take me through this (aussie):\

he says the power of not working in the terminal means you are going to have to use GUI\'92s tools or work on things that will take hours instead of minutes.  This has piqued my interest.  \
\
he said the mac terminal can sometimes be referred to as the command line.  \
\
the guys introduction could be something i will look into if i ever do this shit, he is introducing himself but using a company name after his introduction like:  My name is michael crawley from boys and their roids dot com\'94  as if making a business perception rather than individual.  \
\
he said being effective in the terminal is a necessary skill for all developers.  Again given his reasons because that means you will have to rely on GUI\'92s.\
\
he has what kevin powell has, a little logo on the video.  \
\
the first bit you see in the mac terminal is called the prompt.  It will differ from computer to computer, but in general is will end in a dollar sign.  \
\
he sees many beginners copying the dollar sign but he says that is not right, it is everything after the dollar sign.  \
\
after that dollar sign is the cursor to show you where you can start typing.  \
\
to find out where we are in the terminal we are going to use, \'91PWD\'92  which stands for print working directory.   when you hit return it will tell you what directory you are in  which is:
\f7\fs84 \cf18 \CocoaLigature0 /Users/michaelcrawley
\f0\fs194 \cf0 \CocoaLigature1  \
\
to get a more visual feel of where you are  after the dollar sign you copy and paste this: 
\f7\fs84 \cf18 \CocoaLigature0 /Users/michaelcrawley
\f0\fs194 \cf0 \CocoaLigature1   as the pwd  and it will open finder to show where you are. \
\
i want to just check something. 8.09 on the video where i left off.   yeah done it.  \
\
this gives you are visual representation of where you are with all the directories in that position.  To replicate that in the terminal we use the command, \'93LS\'94  which simply means list and it will show you all the directories in that position.  \
\
the directories will be the exact same as it is in finder, if you count them up you will see it is the exact same number of directors as each other.  Except if a directory is hidden, like the library directory seems to be.  \
\
to access the directory in finder we either click or double click, to do that in terminal we do:  cd, which means change directory. \
\
\'93cd -\'93  or cd .. means you get to go back a directory.  to get around the bracket problem when accessing a mac direcotory in the terminal you have to enclose the command in inverted commas.  it is after the cd command that you put in the Inverted commas.  The inverted commas are to be over the directory.  I will maybe do it for all directories.  \
\
this 
\f7\fs84 \cf18 \CocoaLigature0 ~ michaelcrawley$ 
\f0\fs194 \cf0 \CocoaLigature1 because the tilda is the the beginning pwd
\f7\fs84 \cf18 \CocoaLigature0 \
\

\f0\fs194 \cf0 \CocoaLigature1 has now changed to this: 
\f7\fs84 \cf18 \CocoaLigature0 iCloud Drive (Archive) michaelcrawley$  \
\

\f0\fs194 \cf0 \CocoaLigature1 to let us know we are in here.  Typing in pwd is better because it lets you see the file path and where you are. \
\
cd .. means go to the parent directory of what we are in.  You need the space to make this work.  the cd . i don\'92t see the use of that yet.  It just stays in the current directory with no change.  if you put in the word clear, it takes out the previous entires and gives you anice screen again.  If you are wondering where the previous entries went it has just been moved down if you scroll back up you can see it.   \
\
This is more like a walkthrough rather than a tutorial.  \'93command K\'94 on a mac is the shortcut to clear the white screen.  The aussie boy says he uses this shortcut pretty frequently.  Control A will take you to the beginning of the sentence again.  \
\
another thing he uses is a tilda which on my keyboard is shift and the button beside the Z.  let me see what this does.\
\
man this is going to be annoying, white space matters in the terminal.  It seems the above step takes us back to starting point of the user file tree.  \
\
ok we are on to creating a new file - we are going to use the touch utility he says.  Weird, I just kind of glanced over this step.  To make a new file in the terminal we do touch then the name of the file like this -  touch text begin.txt\
\
to open that file we put the word open the begin to type the file, if you hit tab and the file exists in your directory you will see that then terminal does a tab completion and fills in the rest of the file.  \
\
I have noticed that while doing LS mirrors what is in finder, it doesn\'92t put the files or folders in the same order.  \
\
autocomplete is another way of putting it.   for example if you have two files beginning with the same letter like for example if to have both a picture file and pathway file/folder, you type open P nothing will open for you because the terminal is confused which P to autocomplete.  if you do the next letter in pictures as I and then to tab then yes it will autocomplete for you because the other directory does not have a second letter like that.  \
\
you hit tab twice it will give you all the folder or files with that letter.  \
\
Ok resume here.  \
\
command s to save and quit with command q. Well that is not as useful as i thought because command q closes all of your text edit applications.  That is annoying.  \
\
He is telling as about this nano tool now to edit documents like text edit via the terminal.   \
\
The nano tool does not have mouse capability, and to save is not command s, it is control o and to exit is control x.  The arrow up is the visual for control button.  we are now going to delete a file via the terminal, with the rm tool.  The rm means remove.  \
\
so to save in the nano tool we do control o then hit return, then the tool will tell you how many lines you have then control x i think to exit.  \
\
to make a directory or a folder in the terminal we do mkdir which is shorthand for make a directory and we will see that a new folder will pop up, yeah it did it was amazing, however it seems that if you have any spacing in your directory name the terminal will just pick one name out of it, there must be clever escape characters to use, in fact i bet it works with quotes lets try that.\
\
Yes it does work with quotes, good.  It seems when using inverted commas it is better to copy and paste the directories or files.  Right he uses underscore i think to avoid using quotes, could be useful.  \
\
all the steps that i have learned like cd and ls etc if we append that with the directory or file name then it gets to the directory quicker, same with making files with the touch command. \
\
Ok he is showing us than naming the files or the directrires with the shorter way means we don\'92t have to be in the files or directories to make any changes to it.  \
\
there is another way to remove a directory you can do rm -r as opposed to rmdir, yeah it seems the rmdir just takes out the folder but not the files in it, whereas rm -r will take away everything.\
\
rm does not send stuff to the trash it deletes it completely, which could be useful when dumping shite files or software.  So be careful when we use it.  \
\
I did something there with vim, having no real idea what it is, research later.  I think it is q to get out i will check that now.  It seems that vim is a bit different.  The syntax relies on the \'93:\'94 first before you type a letter.  so to quit vim we have to first type the escape the the full colon, that brings you down to the bottom cursor.  You then hit q and enter.  I think q and ! is force quit.  Yeah full colons are really powerful as a vim syntax. \
\
There is a cheat sheet to use, bookmark that.  \
\
ls - a command list all the files including the hidden ones, i tried to open the ds store file, but it says i have an application that i cannot open it with.  The other hidden files open fine, i think it is better off to leave this one.  \
\
the ls - l (L standing for Longform information)  \
\
you can also do ls -la  for the long form plus the hidden files.    ok the @ after the Longform list on the file means it has an extra attribute information which you can access via ls -l@\
\
find out what system the mac is versus windows etc, so you know what you are working with.  \
\
primer in computing like a textbook introduction to using something.  \
\
sudo requires admidatrative privileges.  It is short for super-user-do.\
\
some are even saying we don\'92t need to use the terminal.  \
\
it seems the windows is ms dos which came to power for the pc market because it was for single user systems, where\'92s as the unix system was for multi-user systems.  \

Q seems to be the way to get out of an application in terminal.    you can list the items even if you are not in the directory.  \
\
cd .. as we know goes back a directory, ../.. goes back two directories.  \
\
we are going to be learning to rename and move directories.  Still not really seen the value in  using terminal yet.  \
\
bash stands for bourne again shell, that is the acronym.  I think it is the default use for the mac terminal.  Yes it says it at the top centre now.  \
\
this might be quite useful,  it seems to copy things much quicker in terminal.   Lets try that with an application of mine.\
\
I might at the end of this put down the commands i have learned off by heart.  \
\
problem locating iCloud in there terminal now.  \
\
finally located the iCloud drive directory, it is in users but under the library section then under the mobile folder.  The library is hidden to see it under guidance mode, the terminal will show it.  You need to hit a key to see it under the mac menu.   \

To copy a file i get to the directory first of all then do:\
 cp file name then the copy to the name you want.  \
\
Tried to copy my masters to a text file, it did it fast but it was gobbled gook.  \
\
Renaming a file and moving a file via the terminal may seem kind of weird because moving a file and renaming a file is actually the same process.  \
\
I am going to have a guess how this works, we do the mv command, which is the move command with the file we want to rename and then space with the renamed file.    i was right.\
\
the moving of files is slightly similar, we do the MV command then the file that is to be moved with the directory that is to be moved to.\
\
To take that file out and put it back where it was with the name changed we do this:\
\
mv filename we want to move with ..(to go up one directory)/with the new file name.  \
\
great tip if we want to learn more with the terminal everything in the man will tell you.  So if you want to know how to copy a directory type man cp and it will have tips to do this. \
\
to copy directories with the -R you need a space after the slash spilt from directory to directory so like this:\
\
cd -R masters copy/ to next masters copy\
\
then it will do it.  \
\
I was trying to make the terminal look better for editing.  It seems that is in a later video by corey.  \
\
man this is so unforgiving in the terminal. To move a directory back up a directory, first we have to get in the directory that we want to take the other directory from\
\
so we do the usual cd to get into the directory\
\
then we do:\
\
mv the directory i want to move/ space ../but this time no space with new mkdir name.  \
\
so to remove the directory we simply do:\
\
rm -R with the directory name we want to remove.\
\
corey said if you get any problems with deleting files or directories we can do a force delete which is\
\
rm -R(for a directory otherwise we don\'92t need this)with the letter f and it should force delete the file or directory. \
\
Corey said watch for using this command because it is extremely powerful.  The only way to recover them is from some kind of back up and that is something nobody wants to do.  \
\
When you are in a browsing state check the concept that no files ever truly disappear.  \
\
He says it is one of these things that you wonder how you lived without these commands once you start using them on a regular basis.  \
\
It looks like we are on to the find command now. Man that is powerful  so, say you are in the documents directory and you have plenty of sub directories in the document directory.  if you do find . return it lists all the directories and the directory files. Let me check that again to make sure. yeah it lists absolutely everything.  Holy shit.  \
\
However to find a specific file or directory we don\'92t use the full stop after the find word  just  find and then the directory.\
\
again amazing there.  If we only want  the directories to show up in the terminal we do find . -type d, and then it returns all the directories.  \
\
Conversely if we just want to find the files without the directories then we just do :\
\
find . -type f hit return\
\
wow that was powerful stuff.  Defnietley to find things in the terminal could be a great idea.  So say I can remember the start of a file name but can\'92t remember how it finishes but i am still trying to find it.  This is what you do:\
\
find . -type f -name \'93filebeginning*\'94 (the asterisk counts as a wild card) and it will go through the parent directory all the way through the sub directories trying to find this file. It found it, amazing.\
\
I thought it would have to be case sensitive, but now there is a way to make it work no matter what case of letter you type in.  This is how you fo this:\
\
find . -type f -iname (instead of name) \'93gant*\'94 return and see what happens. - Don\'92t forget the wild card.  \
\
The wild card thing he is showing us, he is saying that it could be useful to look for files with weird extensions.  \
\
so you use the asterix to mean anything that ends in the file extension you are looking for.  Try it for rtf extension.\
\
an rtf file is a rich text format file.  I just want to see if you can open these file with that format from the find results.  \
\
yes you can open it like that - remember some files might have brackets in them which you will need inverted commas for.  \
\
Wow this tool really is amazing, you can go all the way back to the root folder and search it in its entirety to find the file you are looking for and then open said file, wow.  \
\
\
That was great too - i don\'92t know if i would use the minutes update, but i think i would use the day measurement.  So what we do here is for finding files that have been updated in the last 10 minutes:\
\
find . -type f -mmin -20 - which means find files that have been updated in the last 20 minutes.\
\
if you are searching for a file that has been used in the last twenty days of so you do this.\
\
find . -type f -mtime -20 - which means find a file that has been updated in the last 20 days.  Powerful stuff.  \
\
you can also do it by size with the -size method:  this might be good for finding out what is clogging up your system:\
\
Images seem to he largest culprit, with videos. Which is perfectly self explanatory.  But to find these files with the size you do this:\
\
find . -type f -size +2M - m -stands for megabyte. hit return  no inverted commas.  \
\
ok try to remember some of the commands i have learned so far.\
\
pwd - print working directory - shows the file path of where you are, in other words the directory you are working on.\
\
bash stands for bourne again shell.\
\
cd   go down a directory.\
\
cd .. go up a directory\
\
cd then directory path, it will open that directory.\
\
ls - list the items in that directory.\
\
ls - a - list the hidden files as well\
\
ls -r just list the directories - no it doesn\'92t do that \
\
ls - f - i would imagine would just list the files lets see this.  No it doesn\'92t, there seems to be a hacker way to do this, but it is better to list the direcotries rather than the files by doing this:\
\
ls -d */ - that lists the directories \
\
delete is the \
\
rm - r and rm -d i think does the same thing, removes the directory. just rm -r\
\
the standard is a file  remove you can put in -i to question this removal.\
\
i just did rm -d and then put in the file name hoping that it would bring up an error on the file removal, it didn\'92t.  shit.\
\
we have to do rm -r then it will just be directories.  \
\
change file name and moving is the same\
\
mv filename with new file name\
\
to move  we do\
\
mv filename to the direcotory we want to move\
\
move and a rename we do  first get into the directory to the file we want to remove, then we do:\
\
mv file name ../with new file name - i don\'92t think we can move from a parent directory to one of the available ones i will try.  \
\
don\'92t know that yet, you may not be able to do that but the way to do it is in two moves, move it up one and then on the chosen one.  Finder does seem faster for that so far.  \
\
copying a file is simply  the cp with the file you want to copy, with the new name you give it.  \
\
copying directories i think is just\
\
cp -R directory name with the new directory lets try this:  that was fast and brilliant, a rand new directory copied just like that.  \
\
the remove is very fast i like that.  \
\
mkdir is make directory good\
\
touch then the file name, makes a file.  \
\
ls -a i think lists the hidden files.  yep\
\
ls -l os longform\
\
ls -la is Longford with the hidden  yep\
\
lets see if there is anything i have missed.\
\
just the find stuff i think.\
\
find . will do every file\
\
find .  -f -iname \'93name*\'94\
\
find .  -f -size +2M\
\
find .  -f -mmin -10\
\
find . -type f -mtime -20\
\
remember the dot.  \
\
taking a side step out here from the terminal to learn about dealing with clients in web development. \
\
How much do you know about web development martin? \
\
Best beginning question to ask Martin - why do you want a website?\
\
Have you thought about hosting?  \
\
Have you got a website address?\
\
Would you like me to give you feedback on the work being done?\
\
How often for you a weekly report, fortnight, monthly?  How do you prefer to communicate?  email? phone? chat?\
\
The focus shouldn\'92t be the website, it should be the business.  The website should be a reflection of that business.  \
\
That is very good - when trying to get through to a client tell them you dealt with a client in the same industry.  \
\
that would be great for a web business, focus on a  business sector and become an expert in that sector.  So you know the industry inside out and can calibrate the website to that industry.  \
\
The hardest part is to get started.  Network, network network.  \
\
trust is everything.  \
\
cool, up to date.  \
\
get that bungalow and the CANI to get it.  \
\
on the find with size small k is kilobyte and big G is gigabyte.\
\
the ls -lah is a great display of list items, it actually tells you the file size of the files.   awesome.\
\
i think this stands for - 
\f12\fs84 \cf20 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Long listing with Human readable file sizes\
\
\

\f0\fs194 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 The find . -empty is good as it lists all the files that are empty.  I thought this would be good for deletion but there seems to be a few empty files for big core applications and maybe they are empty for a reason, in that they get filled up while using the application, like a log for example.  \
\
chmod - is a short term abbreviation meaning change mode.  I think 777 means that it is readable and writable by everyone.  \
\
background-size : contain might be a neat little trick.  it seems to keep the image in the box.  \
\
maybe contain and cover do the same thing?\
\
yes 777 gives anyone the right to read, write and amend files.\
\
775 is for the owner and group to have permissions, not anyone.  \
\
he said before you mass delete files, run a find command first to make sure you are going to delete the right files.  \
\
chown - change owner.  \
\
the max depth of one means to just search the current directory, don\'92t go down sub directories. \
\
he also showed a way to change permissions with the terminal, no need for a python script.  \
\
staying in the one directory is the following:\
\
find . -type f -iname \'93*.jpg\'94 maxdepth 1 \
\
to go up two directories we do cd ../.. - no space.  \
\
\{\} the curly brackets in the terminal act as a placeholder.\
\
-exec means execute.  \
\
yeah the find command not only lets you find the results you are wanting but it also allows you to append commands on to the find command to manipulate the find results, like find then delete the files etc.  \
\
\
\{\} as the place holder, may mean that if you want to delete a particular file, you would put that in the placeholder - don\'92t know about this.  The + or ; ends the command request in the terminal.  \
\
the weeMan.jpg is gone.  \
\
that is the end of this video - he said if you take the time to learn the find command, it can be quite powerful.  \
\
we are on to the Grep command.\
\
grep stands for global regular expression print.  and it allows us to search for some text in files within our system.\
\
we can also tell it to just use completed words with w and the line number with n.  \
\
The find with the remove works like this:\
\
find . -type f -iname \'93wee*\'94 - maxdepth 1  - exec rm \{\} +\
\
Again the max depth just means to stay searching on the directory you are in, do not go down one directory.  \
\
so the trick to this seems to be the syntax - .\
\
so far the grep looks ok, but i think the command f is better with the find so far.  \
\
the letter after the  dash command seems to be the argument like -type f  -size 2M  -iname  \'93mike\'94 etc\
\
-B means the lines before and 4 would be the argument for that like = -B 4.\
\

\f0\fs194 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \
it means it is counting the rtf as a binary file - to get around this and read a binary file as if it were text we simply to -a after the grep command like this:\
\
grep -a -win -B 4 \'93is there such a thing\'94 safe steroids.rtf\
\
to see lines after we just do the uppercase A option -A\
\
yeah i can see the power of this, probably better in a html file though.  \
\
strongly enough to see the lines before and after our entry it is not -BA as i would have thought but -C - strange.  \
\
I am going to think of -C as combined to aid remembering it, corey said he uses this all the time.  \
\
w stands for whole word i stands for not case sensitive n stands for line lol. \
\
good i though the -a command would do a search through the whole direcotroy treating all files within it as a binary file but no it changes the binary to text and the non binary stays as text cool.  \
\
ok the grep command to search through all files to find the key word you are looking for only works if you are in the directory with the file in question, it is not like the find command where it can cascade from the root directory down.  With text files is doesn\'92t seem like the best command again, i would use the find on word for this.  \
\
ok he is going to give us a solution for this, is was as almost that he could read my mind.  \
\
we are doing a recursive search with -R  which repeats the process through all the directories from root to child to find what we are looking for.  \
\
it is not big R it is just small r on top of the -win. \
\
cool, this is going to be complicated with grep - the asterix i don\'92t think is needed if you do the -r thing.  \
\
apparently not only do we not need the asterix if we are doing it recursively but we do not need the / backslash either.  \
\
Like i experienced he said be careful with the recursive searches because if it is a big directory you are in it will search the whole god damn thing for it and it will take a long time to find what you are looking for.  \
\
cool the l will just show the files that have that match, leaving it up to you to find it, that might be better.  you take the n out and put the l in.  the n is out because you arte not going through the file line by line.  \
\
if you replace the l with c it will tell you the files that has the match but also how many times it has that phrase in its file.  Interesting.  \
\
he used the phrase, \'91pipe\'92 i thought pipe was just an expression, but apparently it is shown by the  this \'93|\'94 mark - the divider mark and it can be used to go through the history to find key phrases you have used.  \
\
it would be like this history | grep \'93big tits\'94\
\
it seems we use grep to search our history i.e show the history of when we searched for the phrase big tits.  \
\
Ok we are the end of his grep video.  I think i must learn about regular expressions.  It almost looks like morse code.  I remember i used it for form validation.  Here he was showing us a way to use grep to look for phone numbers in his file something like\
\
grep \'93\'85-\'85-\'85.\'94  and where to find it file name\
\
It sounds complicated, but trying to dechipher by the name alone, is a phone number a regular expression?\
\
He then goes on to mention something about perl regular expression and the grep installed by mac doesn\'92t use this whereas Linux does.\
\
all you have to do with linux is do grep -P and it will go into the perl expression.\
\
you can\'92t do this with the mac, so a way around this is to use homebrew (he called this a package manager)  where i think as the name suggests is that it aims to proved the same functionality no matter what operating system terminal you are using.  The same way a password manager works. Not quite the case.\
\
now after installing home-brew which i think works like this\
\
home-brew install\
\
you then have to open up a new window and locate the direcotry you were in originally and then you can use the grep command that works in linux to work in the mac.  \
\
seems i have to learn what are regular expressions and what is hombrew.\
\
get that tomorrow.\
\
Ok I don\'92t think i need to go down the rabbit hole of knowing the reg expressions exactly yet.  However it seems to be different that the regular search method you get in the GUI.  The regular search method gives back literal searches like find the word, \'93maker\'92 etc.  However the reg expression search is one where you want to find meta searches like find all phone numbers or find all email addresses or find all words with maker and an email address in the search.  Reg expression seems to be an advanced search tool, which is used in validation.  You can\'92t do these in literal find tools in the gui and it would take you ages.  For example if you did find, \'91all emails\'92 in the search guy tool it would bring back exactly that -the phrase, \'91find all emails\'92 no actually any emails lol.    \

After all that, essentially  homebrew is to make the typical software instalaation process easier.  For example, the mac comes with apache pre installed but without mysql.  It also doesn\'92t have node or other potentially needed software installed, so rather than going direct to the vendor to install lets say node.js we can install homebrew and make a request to install node via them.  We want to do it this way because it apprantely makes the installation process very simple.  That is essentially what they do.  Almost cuts out all the steps for you.  \
\
good i can continue.  \

Now we are on to the learning how to use the curl command.  \

I am looking forward to this, this is a sideway glance at brad from travesty media where he is telling us what he thinks curl is.  \
\
He said it is a great tool for testing REST API\'92s, downloading files.  \
\
He said that developers would use POSTMAN to test apis, but curl is another option.  Yes, as i thought POSTMAN is a gui tool.  \
\
in this tutorial Brad is going to be using HTTP and FTP with curl. \
\
interesting git for windows gives a whole unix based commands you can use in windows terminal, curl being one of them.  \
\
he says that git is a better command line than the powershell which i think is windows default.  \
\
ah he gives us a website we can use to test fake apis it is called :

a put is an update, yeah like amending an already post request data.  \
\
curl -i (includes) the url data plus  the header information.  \
\
some stuff brad doesn\'92t understand in the header information - which raises the question, \'93how much does a web developer need to know?\'94  - i thought this guy was a wealthy wed dev expert?\
\
ah i see the curl \'97head (header) just brings back the header information with no JSON data.  \
\
curl capital I (item header info) url will do the same thing too.  Most of these options have a dash version and a dash dash version.  \
\
this could be interesting, here we are going to learn about taking information from the web and putting it into a file.  YES!!\
\
wow this is exciting what i do to test it is, first i create a directory called testing apis and then i download the curl json while being in that directory.  Amazing.  \
\
wow that felt like the first time being a software developer, i took data from an outside website and downloaded it into my own directory.  lets see if i can take an outside website stuff?\
\
wow i took html from a website called stagers chat and put it in my folder and open it in the browser and it rendered the exact same as if it was my own.  I open up the editor and there it was, all the code from that website.  This might be good for learning how to do websites, see the tricks others use. \
\
Although one other boy said to use what you already know about html, css and javascript and without looking at the source code, make the same website.  Might be a good project idea.  \
\
A question to ask, is how do I find out if the javascrtipt file has been encrypted in the browser?  I will do this now.\
\
Right that foray into how to read minified or obfuscate code in the chrome browser, the answer is you can\'92t.  Hackers can reverse engineer it and work it out, what your variable names do etc, but it is hard work.  \
\
Until i am in such a position to spend time debugging the code if i am trying to reverse engineer a stranger\'92s website source, the present advice is to not waste your time with deciphering minified javascript code, just keep viewing websites until you find one that has not been minified, like mine for example.  \
\
chrome has a tool to de minify it in the browser highlighted by two \{\} at the bottom left of the dev tool.  However that doesn\'92t show the original variable name, it just makes the variable a, b and c easier to read that is all.  \
\

Ok, i seems there is a quick way to get  a job, what i have been doing is the meticulous way.  That will have me in good stead no doubt about it but i am maybe missing a trick with the avaivble technologies to expedite the production process.  \
\
Apis seem to be the rage.  The ability to take well needed useful, information from large coorporations and sort it into a user experience format in your own website is a skill that is highly thought of.  So think quality not quantity for the portfolio and have an app that takes apis data for other websites and have in yours and sort the data in an interesting ux way, also think about creating your database with the api information.  \
\
The senior boy mentioned something about google cloud having a cheap way to host full stack stuff.  netifly seems to have a form capitibality you can plug into your website.  Gastby seems a website for making portfolio stuff.  \
\
in the GitHub section of your projects, have the same process as your masters thesis with having a read me section beside your project code.  The senior boy was also mentioning have commits on your GitHub with all the stages you did.  Like the other guy said, do it in sprints.  Log in page here, authentication here, hero section here, etc etc.  \
\
research api ideas, what you can do with the information to bring some originality to the data?  Solve a business problem.  Like mimic a patron site, try and show real value to the employer.  \
\
These are good ideas.  \
\
Back to curl. \

oh aye with getting apis, the file path seems to be everything - so \'93/\'93 is all the rage.\
\
to make you own file path and download the outside websites info curl -o or curl - - output (which means output).\
\
cat i think is computer aided translation \
\
if you do curl -O (big o) it will download the data into its made file and the can use ls then cat or open to see it.  \
\
to get images downloaded with curl, we do the copy image address after the right click, then big O and it will have the image name exactly, without you giving a name to it.  Amazing!.\
\
Also when i want access to the background image, i extend the screen in google dev tools to see the url then i locate the file in the file source and then i copy url and boom I have got it with curl.\

From TFM (
\f7\fs102 man curl
\f2\fs106 ) --limit-rate Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use. This feature is useful if you have a limited pipe and you'd like your transfer not to use your entire bandwidth.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f7\fs102 \cf8 \cb1          The  given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a suffix is\
         appended.  Appending 'k' or 'K' will count the number  as  kilo-\
         bytes,  'm'  or M' makes it megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it\
         gigabytes. Examples: 200K, 3m and 1G.\
\
         The given rate is the average speed counted  during  the  entire\
         transfer. It means that curl might use higher transfer speeds in\
         short bursts, but over time it uses no more than the given rate.\
\
         If  you  also  use the -Y/--speed-limit option, that option will\
         take precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting slightly, to\
         help keeping the speed-limit logic working.\
\
         If this option is used several times, the last one will be used.\

and it downloaded the jpg file really slowly, but if you have limited bandwidth this might be useful, who knows. \
\
so we are doing a post request now with curl to actually add data.  I think it is this:\
\
curl -d (for data) 0r - - data then the name value pairs like\
title=smith  is a cunt,body=and a gasbag\
\
i think in the url it is written like this ?title=smith+is+a+cunt&body=and+a+bawbag\
\
that was nearly right, i don\'92t know why i couldn\'92t see that the name value pairs reflect the way the json file has been created - like i think if you do it without curl you append the url with \'93it is either ? or / then quotes \'93title=Hello Baby&(no space)body=how are you today?\'94\
\
with curl you do:\
\
curl -d \'93title=Hello You!&body=How are you today?\'94 with the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"}}{\fldrslt

\
i wonder if the way it is done in curl and with javascript or php is different?\
\
may as well try and get this api to work.\
\
Ok took a side way glance from curl and moved to javascript to see if i could bring an open source\'92s api information back to my website.  I eventually got it, however i have noticed the documentation of these apis still make some assumptions.  \
\
The first step from the open library api is to take the data using jsonp, however  they don\'92t tell you that , they just make assumption that you know this technique.  Jsonp pops up quite a lot, my quick glance of google books api  uses the script tag too, but that is to connect to its book library, which is the api, i would say it is a javascript library rather than a tradtiotonal api. \
\
Anyway back on point, the open library uses jsonp - they calling these json with padding, but a prefer graeme\'92s definition, json with parenthesis or brackets.  \
\
A few things took a while to figure out. when i see the json strutted tree look like this\
(callback\
\{\
\
\'93ISBN:048794567\'94: \{\
\
\'93bib_key\'94:\'94ISBN:048794567\'94,\
\'93preview\'94:\'94noview\'94,\
\}\
\}\
)\
\
it means that the ISBN:048794567 is the root object name and to get into the child objects, you have to start with the root.  \
\
Other thing to bear in mind is that using this jsonp method, my data came back already as a javascript object, which is what you want to begin extracting the data.  there was no need to parse the data, which leads me on to my next point.\
\
JSON.parse() takes a string of data and makes it into a javascript object.\
\
On the other hand JSON.stingligy() does the opposite.  It takes an object\'92s data and makes it a string.\
\
The more experienced i get at using the console, the more i will know  what data type each is.\
\
Also when we are using the jsonp method remember the order of the script tags.\
\
if you have the jsonp script tag before the script tag where you have called that jsonp script then it will not out put because you have the call to the function before the function has been created.  TL:DR callback script tag after the made function script tag.\
\
also when i am working with the dom it seems there comes up a console error when i have the script tags in the head when using jsonP.  It seems my callback and my unload event was clashing.  A way around this seems to be to move the script tags to underneath the body html document and i think there is no need to call the load event, because the script functionality will come after the dom has been loaded, which is what you want.  Also the load event and the jsonP call back had the same callback name, which not only confused things but was giving a console type error even though the data did render properly.  \
\
i will research where the best place is to put the script tags,  I am thinking now it is the body tags because if i remember the latest head first book did have the javascript in the body tag. - do this now.  \
\
yeah it seems after the body tags is the best place to do this -   \

\fs92 t is a best practice to put JavaScript <script> tags just before the closing </body> tag rather than in the <head> section of your HTML.\
The reason for this is that HTML loads from top to bottom. The head loads first, then the body, and then everything inside the body. If we put our JavaScript links in the head section, the entire JavaScript file will load before loading any of the HTML, which could cause a few problems.\

If you have code in your JavaScript that alters HTML as soon as the JavaScript file loads, there won't actually be any HTML elements available for it to affect yet, so it will seem as though the JavaScript code isn't working, and you may get errors.\cb1 \
\ls3\ilvl0\cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 {\listtext	2.	}\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
If you have a lot of JavaScript, it can visibly slow the loading of your page because it loads all of the JavaScript before it loads any of the HTML.\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl434\sa420\partightenfactor0
\cf31 \cb3 When you place your JavaScript links at the bottom of your HTML body, it gives the HTML time to load before any of the JavaScript loads, which can prevent errors, and speed up website response time.\

The modern approach\
Today, browsers support the async and defer attributes on scripts. These attributes tell the browser it's safe to continue parsing while the scripts are being downloaded.\
async\
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script1.js" async></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script2.js" async></script> Scripts with the async attribute are executed asynchronously. This means the script is executed as soon as it's downloaded, without blocking the browser in the meantime. This implies that it's possible script 2 is downloaded & executed before script 1.\
80% of all browsers support this.\
defer\
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script1.js" defer></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/script2.js" defer></script> Scripts with the defer attribute are executed in order (i.e. first script 1, then script 2). Like the async attribute, this does not block the browser.\
Unlike async scripts, defer scripts are only executed after the entire document has been loaded.\
80% of all browsers support this. 88% support it at least partially.\
An important note on browser compatibility: in some circumstances IE <= 9 may execute deferred scripts out of order. If you need to support those browsers, please read this first!\

Perhaps the biggest thing i learned and again something the community doesn\'92t really emphasise is the dot notation versus the obj literal method or bracket notation.    \
\
Invalid identifier.  the other name is called bracket notation.\
\
The consensus seems to be to use bracket notation when dot notation doesn\'92t work.  There is also a trivial argument that dot notation may be faster for the javascript engineerings to parse as it knows what to do upfront.  Whereas with the bracket notation it has to work it out after all the code base has been rendered.  \
\
tips for using bracket notation.\
\
One - when the property name is an invalid identifier like the isbn number as a string and with a colon in the name like this \
\
\'93ISBN:5555555\'94\{\
\
\}\
\
2 - when the property name is a number like \
\{\
\'932\'94 : \'934\'94\
\
\}\
\
3. when do are doing a dynamic call to the object\'92s proprties via a variable like this:\
\
\
var name = \'93prop1\'94;\
\
\
var objectWithProps   = \{\
\
\'93prop\'94 : \'93smith\'94,\
\'93prop1\'94 : \'93mcguamflit\'94,\
\'93prop2\'94 : \'93shanter\'94\
\
\};\
\
now if you do this > console.log(name) that will return the string \'93prop1\'94  \
\
however if you do this objectWithProps[name] then the value will be smith.  \
\
now onto using bracket notation with nested objects.  Nothing new here, just that to display the data you can mix and match the bracket notation with the dot notation.  \
\
I think what might be harder to find out is why bracket notation can display invalid identifiers that dot notation cannot, does that mean it doesn\'92t follow conventions?\

yeah i noticed i got a message which said skipping directory which means it was making just a backup of your files and not backing up sub directories. but if you use the recursive -R it will back-up the files and the sub directory\'92s.  Cool.  and you do not need the wild card key.  So it goes something like this:\
\
Recursion function is a function that calls itself.  Ah i think i have got it with the recursive file structure.  What it means that with the -r function call it goes from the root directory through all the integrated files and then it goes back to the top and repeats the process for any sub directories.  Cool.\
\
rsync -r Dissertation backupDisssertation.\
\
cool. \
\
the trailing slash is important this character =/\

if we leave this out then it rsyncs the directory folder, meaning that that back up directory will be the father of the directory you backed up.  So keep it in just brings the files within the directory without the  directory itself.  cool.  \

the dash a option stands for archives and it has many different methods within it, like to copies the meta details of the file contents over like the owner of the directory and the permissions too.  \
\
wow that dry run thingy is great \'97dry-run  it lets you make sure the rsync is going to rsync the proper files.  cool.\

v stands for verbose where it does the function and also tells you the output from that function.  \

yes it seems i got it, just a simple move with no -r or nothing for files or directories, just the pain the arse you have to know the root address of the directory you are going to move things to, but yet you can move things that are nested in a directory as long as you have the directory path to move it too.  All about the file path.  \
\
right back to this rsync again, after doing the dry run.  i like the -v for verbose to tell you what happened, it probably does that with the move too.  Yes it does, it tells you what it was and what it has been moved to.  \
\
yes the strength rsync has over just cp is that with rsync say you have made a backup of most of your files but you notice you have two missing, when you do an rsync it will know just to copy the two resining files rather than making a complete copy again of all your files.  This saves a lot of time and is much more efficient.  lets try that\
\
Corey says he doesn\'92t really do the next step, but i do see the use.  For example say you make a back up of your website files.  But some time goes by and in the master folder you have deleted some files along with other file updates.  That would mean your back up would one not be updated, but two have more files than the original master folder.  \
\
to get round this we can do the delete function from the master to the backup this gives the computer the smarts to take out the files from the back up that no longer mirrors the original and updates the rest.  You end up having a perfect sync.  A tip here is always to do a dry run with this type of function call because there have been horror stories where the master file is a bit empty while the back up hold all the content, if you do it like this it will take out all the files or your project. Having said that, it goes something like this;\
\
rsync -av - - delete - - dry-run master folder backupFolder.\
\
ok cool.\
\
I think this has just dawned on me it seems with the rsync command we can clone and back up files to other machines with different operating systems, maybe even in another country.  You need their ip address and their SSHaccess.  He sets up virtual machines to do this.  \

\cf0 bash is a shell - bourne again shell. The shell commands are the command line calls in the bash shell.\
\
ssh stands for secure shell and it was a way of connecting to a remote machine over the internet.  It was brought in mainly because of the internet network.  There were other protocols for transferring data across a network, like talent rsh however when the internet became a part of our lives they were considered not the best way to connect to a remote machine because they sent all the dat through the network in view of anyone that would want to intercept it like with a packet sniffer technology.  \
\
These previous methods worked fine in local networks where the people sending the data worked in the organisation and probably all ready knew the data they were sending, so think system admin guys etc, so ssh wasn\'92t a specific need.  \
\
but with the internet, leaving your data opened to nefarious third parties a new method was needed.  \
\
A boy from finland came up with ssh and it involved encrypting the data so that packet sniffers could not see the actual data that was being transferred.  they would maybe know that there was data getting transerefed but couldn\'92t see what it was.  \

A cluster in computing seems a way to share resources or computer process efficiently.  These computer clusters are computers that seem to have no pc screen or keyboard attached, they are really just the hard drives.  Typically they do not store any data, they are liked to a storage server or mainframe for that.  However theses clusters are structured like a json or xml data format.  In that there is a head computer that answers the queries from the lan or the wan and then divvys up the computing among the computers in the clusters.  For example once computer looks after calculations, another data fields etc, etc.  Another reason they exist is that if the head computer experiencing a performance bottleneck, the others share the load.\

\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs262 \cf0 So he says we have only scratched the surface of what the basic files and bash profile files can do.\
\
looking at GitHub here, we can tell how popular a GitHub repository is by the amount of stars it has on the top right side and the amount of forks it has had, again on the top right side.  \
\
a cool wee thing there i saw him with sublime is that if you want to make sure sublime is following the proper syntax, if you click at the bottom right it will give you options in which to navigate the page.  cool.\
\
ok when i start using git in my terminal then maybe these dot files are going to be useful, as it well tell me where i am in the git repository and how where i am uploading them and whether i have made a commit or not.  So bookmark this and park this for now.  \
\
learning shortcuts here for quick using in the terminal.  \
\
first one i know, control a, takes you to the beginning of the line.  \
\
control e goes to the end of the line, think of e as end.  \
\
option and arrow left and right to jump back and forth one line at a time.  \
\
another thing if you hold down the option key and click with the mouse you can move the cursor to any letter.  \
\
if you hit control u it will delete everything before the cursor.\
\
yeah lack of gym is keeping my mind weak.   \
\
control k deletes everything after the cursor.\
\
the tab key autocompletes, i know this. \
\
i got way to get into the file root, is to have the word cd already put in, then drag and drop the file in the terminal to display the file path.  \
\
the up and down arrows help to go through previous terminal commands but if you want to see a command from a long time ago do ! and then the start of the command like find and it will bring back the last find command it sees in the history.  You then to up on the arrow to display this command in the prompt.  \
\
instead of doing copy and paste to find a step in your history, what you can do is find the step in your history and do an exclamation mark with the number of the history command and it will do that command for you.  \
\
not the bst one here, control r will reverse search for you, i think this is an alternative for using the arrows.  \
\
again to help my studying, maybe do the uni technique where i osciualte between the stuff i have to learn, to the stuff i want to learn.  \
\

\
use a component library like materials for design tips.  Investigate further.  Oh aye, he could be a little of a bullshit artist, his design is from a code camp, he stole it.  This guy is obviously not very strong with css.  \

ok this is quite good for web sites because we for websites to load quickly we need the images to be smaller when the screen gets smaller, especially for smaller screen sizes, it will keep the website fast.  \
\
so the first tip is to make three folders for your images, large, medium and small.  Begin with large and then place the large into the medium and then small.  Finally change the name of the medium and small images. \
\
ok lets see.  -exec means execute remember.  \

\fs262 \cf0 the above command is golden to change all the pics names.  \
\
and  the below command is golden to move large images into another folder, making the same images small - awesome.  \

\fs262 \cf0 This above code seems to also take out the \
the amount of resolution out the photo making it smaller and therefore less loading time.  So when i am making a large small and medium image folder, maybe think about leaving the default of where you got it alone as a separate folder. \
\
ok on to the portfolio with kevin and flex box.  \
\
this is about the process as well as to how to build. \
\
I downloaded node with npm as well. \
\
-g means globally, wherever we are using our computer.  \
\
right looks like i have my sass ready and watching my project file.  \
\
quite a good idea to have an option for the employer to download your cv.\
\
just linked In and GitHub buttons, projects with code and display have the portfolios right away for the person to look at, simple design, one page. \
\
Ok back to Kevin. \
\
I think this is the perfect job for me.  I can\'92t think of anything better.  Use my brain and not much physical exertion.  it seems i am really passionate about this.  The other professions, law, doctor, accountancy, engineering, pilot none of these really interest me or sales and trades don\'92t hold the status i am after.  What a lucky boy.  Right let\'92s do this. Man I might actually be on the road to happiness, of course bad bosses might get in the way lol.  I love the brain power, yes. \
\
The bald thing.  We do look similar from the sides.  Keep it clipped, i am bigger built than that guy i saw, keep it like that when you are  bald and keep it clipped to look your best.  Side on doesn\'92t really matter anyway, women are not interested in that, they like face on.  Don\'92t bitch anyway, they don\'92t like that either.  Don\'92t play the victim.  I am fine.  Cool Move on and remember what you are preoccupied with others are not, that is true too.    \
\
Ok a series of steps so far, when beginning a project.  First of all on GitHub it is not a new project you choose, it is a new repository.  Name the repository, keep it public and on the git ignore button choose sass.\
\
there is a site called gitignore.io which has been taken over by topal i think.  But it allows you to create a script of the things you want GIT to ignore.  You then copy and paste that into the editor from the home GitHub page to ignore and commit changes, directly to your master branch.\
\
\
learning now GitHub from terminal.\
\
Ok jumping back with corey here, he is going to take us through the workings of git which is the most powerful version control out there.  \
\
Ok he sells the command line methods for git on the proviso that even though gui tools are useful, you can only go so far until you run into trouble and you need some underlining understanding of the command line to take it forward.  \
\
git is a distributed version control system not a centralised one like svn - it is apaches. \
\
A central version control system is located in one place.  This can be problematic if you can\'92t get access to that central access or central repository.  \
\
for example if your server is offline or you don\'92t have a network connection then you will only be able to work with the files you have checked out from that repository and no additional information about that centre repository.\
\
If anything happens to that central repository then you have got to hope there is a back up to that code some where.   \
\
Now on the other hand with something like a distributed system like git everyone has access to the central repository via their local repository.  You can also get access to the central repository but the local repository can be the same as the central ones the last time you rysunced them together.  So in a way everyone has a back up of the central repository stored on their local machine.  \
\
the top of bash tells you what is happening, whether it is downloading or not.  \
\
Ok i think i have fixed the homebrew issue and now git is installed.  \
\
after i get it installed i have to make my name and email known so that others can see who is making the changes.  \
\
git config \'97 list 
\f13\b will check all the configurations here
\f0\b0 .  \
\
Corey has more values than us because he customised git over time, which may be beneficial to me.  \
\
you then go to the directory you want to work with and then do a 
\f13\b git init - git initialise
\f0\b0  and it will put git to work on this directory.  \
\
we can do rm -rf.git if we want to remove git from the directory.  \
\
hit an hour and six minutes, i think it is going to be helpful to tell if we are in a git repository or not, i am going to integrate that script .dot file for corey to make the terminal look better for git. \
\
aliases is customising the keyboard shortcuts remember that.   \
\
the code i am looking at with the dot files will make the host change colour if i am accessing via my local machine or from a remote machine, i think tis is for git i am not sure.  \
\
Right i think that is me integrated them now and it is telling me where i am in my git repository.  \
\
i think this:\

command lets me do the changes without starting a new terminal, cool.  \
\
This guy seem to do the changes in the reverse order to us, we used the bashrc file, he used the bash_prompt file.\
\
ok cool.\
\
yes perhaps working in an office will bite my energy a little, but nothing i can\'92t sort.  We will see.  Again, my energy might get even better with the barbell. Time will tell.  Yes it does help to write down my thoughts.  I love clairey and she is well better than Beatrice and yes i am punching.\

\f0\fs262 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 ok so if you use git status and you see \
\
.gitignore in there it means that you need to create a gitignore file and tell git it ignore certain files for example all the custom changes you have done to git prompt you do not want that uploaded to GitHub.  \
\
so git status is important.\
\
Corey did a good example of working with git.  He broke it down with in the working directory locally then moving the files to the staging area via:\
\
git add -A or git add then the file name for individual file.  \
\
that kind of puts it in a layaway like a purgatory (staging area), so if you are happy with the changes you then do a git commit and it will move upload these files to GitHub.  \
\
then doing git status will tell you what has just happened.  \
\
if you want to remove git files from the staging area you do git  reset command.  either again per file or all the files with just git reset.\
\
if i accidentally commit without a message this happens and to solve it follow the below instructions :\

\f0\fs262 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 so that is good that git calls for a message before i commit.  \
\
git log will tell you all about your commits.\
\
Ok corey said when working from companies we will be beginning with the git clone method from the remote repository.  So:\
\
git clone url and the directory you want it to go on your local computer.  \
\
if you do a 
\f13\b dot
\f0\b0  after the url it just means the current directory.  Cool. \
\
Good he is going to go over branches.  Git remote -v will tell you where the git clone came from\
\
and git branch -a will tell you  the branch you are working in both locally and remote. \
\
git diff shows you the changes you have made to the code.  Clever.  \
\
I thought after commit the changes are uploaded to GitHub but no that is just a local change.  It is only when you code in git push that it goes to GitHub.   Clever again.  \
\
git status i will be using a lot of.\
\
he said before you push it you do a git pull, he said people forget to do this, but you have to remember that you could be working on a project with multiple developers.  \
\
what git pull does is that it will pull in any changes from the master that have been updated by someone else working on the same project, before you push your code.  I think this is do with versions.  \
\
origin is just the name of the remote repository the responsiveness \'97start to finish.  and the master is just the branch we want to push too.  \
\
he said using the master branch is not the way to be using git from day to day.  I think the branches have the advantage of first naming them so it is like a chronological order of breaking up your project bit by bit.  Like branch nav, branch slider etc etc.  \
\
git branch then add branch name\
\
hit git branch again and it will list the branches in your repository, then git checkout with branch name to switch the branch from the master to what i have called the beginning branch.\
\
if you do 
\f13\b git push with -u
\f0\b0  then that means git will remember what you are pushing and pulling from now on, so you just thereafter only need to do git push and git pull and it will know you mean that branch you are working on.  \
\
ah i see when you do git branch -a it also shows you in red the remote branches too.  Ok the branches from a company perspective is so they can do their unit tests before  merging it with the master branch.\
\
Ok the architecture or the process of working with git and GitHub seems to be  that you clone the repository that you are to be working on to your local directory.  You create a branch off the master to begin working on the project.  You do your changes to your branch, you commit those changes to your local machine.  You then push those changes to GitHub, then unit testing will be done on your changes, once you team is happy with the changes you merge this branch with the master, you commit and push the master to GitHub and then get rid of the branch you were working on and then repeat the process until you have a finished project ready to be deployed. \
\
to delete the branch we do:\
\
git branch -d then the branch name\
\
however that only deletes the branch locally, you still have it remotely.\
\
to delete it from GitHub it is this syntax here:\
\
git push origin \'97 -delete branch name.  \
\
git branch -a will be used a lot too with git status.  \
\
he said it was a lot to take in but he says it becomes not that hard when it becomes part of your daily routine.  \
\
he calls this a workflow.  \
\
there is things he didn\'92t cover like merge conflicts, undoing, tag, cherrypicking.  etc.  \
\
git clean -f is for force not files.  there are a few tutorials to go but i think they will be super useful.  American expression there lol.\
\
remember baldness separates us as a man, it is masculine.  \
\
Ok lets see if i remember the  steps for git.\
\
git init to get git in your directory.  \
\
but perhaps not going to do it that way, it will be the clone method.\
\
get the git url and open up the directory where you want to clone the git repository.\
\
you then do git clone url with the directory you want it in.\
\
git status to see if it is in there.  \
\
if there is not an ignore file, create one.  you can use topals website to ignore the files you don\'92t need like the mac operating system and the sass files. \
\
split up the master with another branch.  \
\
with:\
\
git branch navbar\
\
do ls\
then do git checkout navbar puts us in the navbar branch.  \
\
git branch -a will tell you what branch you are working on.  \
\
if you do any changes in your git branch then save those changes and then do git diff it will tell you the changes.  \
\
Ok here are all the steps as far as i can remember:\
\
first you clone the GitHub to your local machine\
\
with the directory you want to be in with \
\
git clone and the GitHub url.  \
\
done.  \
\
then\
\
git status to see what is happening in your local directory.  It may tell you to create a local gitignore, do it.  \
\
it will be the master branch that we have downloaded.  so create a new branch with the name of the functionality you want to be working on wit  git branch and the name of the new branch\
\
then do git branch again to see all your branches in your directory.\
\
then do git checkout and what branch you want to change to.   Open up your files in sublime and begin working on your project.  \
\
save the changes then do a git status again to see what needs to ne committed.  Do git add and add the files to purgatory.  then do git diff and it will tell you what has been changed.  If you are happy with the changes do git commit and the changes will be made in your local git repository.  \
\
before you push the change to git hub you must pull the origin master to see ( i don\'92t think that step would apply when working with a branch).\
\
In retrospect just in case and to get in the habit do the git pull origin master.  wait for the feedback, if all ok  then push your branch to GitHub.  Once done that is the brach up, do git branch-a to see if it is there in red writing.  \
\
wait for unit testing to be completed.  Happy with the changes then you do a git merge orgigin master \
\
the do a git pull origin master for any updates the team has been working on and then if ok do a push.\
\
once that is done open up local branch that has been completed and do git branch -d branch name.\
\
git branch will show it is away from you local machine.\
\
to delete from GitHub we do:\
\
git origin brach name - - delete and it is deleted from GitHub.  \
\
repeat the process.\
\
git remote -v tells who the origin of the repository on GitHub is.  \
\
git log for al log of last jobs. \
\
git reset will take away the files from git purgatory.  \
\
if you haven\'92t got looks you have got brains, think Jimmy McGill and the boy that owed mersia verda.  So true, no victim.  \
\
good.\
\
in this video with corey we will be looking at a few common mistakes and how to undo bad commits.  \
\
he says some of these commands will change the git history and some will not.\
\
Cani with the brain.  \
\
that is quite good there when you do ls -a in a git local repository you can see that it has ignored the .dsstore files because it doesn\'92t come up.  sweet.  \
\
ok this step may take time to get use to.  But say i make a change.  In fact do this now.  Doesn\'92t work until i add the files.  \
\
but for assumption sake say that i did, what happens is when i do a git status it will tell me that a file has been modified, then when i do a git diff it will show the modification.  However, if i just do a git checkout on the file that has been modified before i commit  it will then go back to the previous version and if i reload subliming it will go back to the previous committed local version.  \
\
this example he is showing is that the ,modification might have been correct but when it comes to committing it the message you gave was incorrect and needs to be changed.  This is what you do:\
\
first do a git log, logs i think are for the commit information.  \
\
to put the right message we simply do \
\
git commits - - amend - m with the right message.  \
\
do git log to see the changed message.  \
\
when you do an amend to a committed message also changes the hash function.  \
\
the hash change is to signify a change in history that is only ok at local repository level, it is not acceptable to change the history of those files you have pushed to GitHub as it may bugger up your teams code, versions i think again.  \
\
he said there is a way to make changes without changing the git history.  \
\
Tim ferris and Derren Brown have the same haircut as me. good.  sleep now.  If they can do it, so can I.   \
\
Yep all good.  The way out of this is to not play the victim.  Other people have much higher struggles than me - blacks, ill educated, poor, women, people that identify as ugly, people with disabilities, gays, transgender,  more light hearted, ginger, bald, too small, too tall, too skinny, too fat.  \
\
The point is when you go down that rabbit hole it never stops.  As Peterson says it is about the individual.  Lets not play the victim and see where it takes me.  We are all individuals.   \
\
cool.    \
\
he said there is a way to make changes without changing the git history. \
\
Bald and proud baby!!\
\
Ok onward.\
\
Ok this is instead of creating a wrong message, lets say what happens when we have a file left to commit that we meant to do with the previous commit.   \
\
So using the same example with the last commit, we simply do git commit - - amend and hit enter\
\
it will bring up the last message as an interactive editor, and just do a double check on the message that everything is ok and click enter  \
\
he said he does a save in that editor and a close out - i hope it is as simple as a normal save.  It might be control O.\
\
if you do git log, it still shows the two commits as normal, yes the hash function has changed, so the git history has changed.\
\
git log - - stat will show the files that have been changed within the committee. \
\
Even thought the git log doesn\'92t show the amendments the git log - - stat will and it will show the files that are part of the last commits.\
\
He reminds us only to do this thing if we haven\'92t push it to other people.  \
\
Now we are going to see what we can do when we have been committing to the wrong branch and then what we do.  \
\
He said this is a fairly common mistake to make.  \
\
So this is a two aim approach, first we want to make the previous commits via the log to the other branch while at the same time putting the master branch back to its initial state.  \
\
This is called cherrypicking.  So we first do a git log and take the hash that we want to change.  \
\
ah i see the order of the logs is most recent the top entry the least recent the bottom entry.  \
\
the first 6 or 7 characters of the hash is fine to copy.  \
\
ah i see with the logs too, the git log will only tell you the logs inside that branch cool.  \
\
so git checkout name of other branch then git log.  \
\
then do a git cherry-pick and paste in the first 6 or 7 characters of the log.\
\
do a git log again and it will show that you brought that commit over to the branch it was suppose to be in.  \
\
But it still exists on the branch we mistakenly used.  \
\
so we have 4 options really.  Git reset - - soft with hash\
git reset - - medium (default) with hash\
\
git reset - - hard with hash\
\
and git clean.  \
\
ok with git reset - - soft hash \
\
it will take the repository back to the state of it being committed but not when it was pushed, so it is in the staging area.\
\
git reset - - medium hash takes it back to having the files but not when they have been committed.  \
\
and git  reset - - hard will take all the tracked files away leaving the untracked like the gitignore file.  \
\
finally the git clean -rf  will take out the untracked files as well and have you repository with nothing in it.  \
\
Wow it really is just bdd with the baldness.  Something the brain just excessively, unduly focuses on.  That happened because i went down the rabbit hole of analysing cock girth.  Broin.  Most women can wrap their hands around it. \
\
deal with the hands you are dealt and it seems as the boys dad said no-one is perfect, implying that most have insecurities.  Confidence really is the turn on.  Good.   \
\
this could be confusing with git and the branches, it is like it creates another directory within a directory yet you can\'92t see it like that way, so the git branch mightt be a way to tell what is happening.  \
\
-a looks it stands for all, -l for local and -r for remote.  \
\
git clean -df gets rid of untracked directories and files.  F is for force i think.  \
\
now we are learning to undo our undos lol.  Like if you git reset hard but you did need some of those changes.  \
\
confidence is everything lol.  He said the git garbage collects after 30 days or so for being on the heap, so if you do a git reset hard and don\'92t see to it within 30 days (depending of course if you need to rectify it) it will be gone.  \
\
git ref log is what we need to use to rectify this undo.  \
\
git reflog (one word).\
\
it is like the log history of everything.  Every little significant movement i think.  \
\
god you can checkout on history log with\
\
git checkout hash history and you are in to that log.\
\
He calls a detached head state.  \
\
from that we create a new branch from the detached head with the log number reflog to hold on to the step that will be taken in the garbage heap.  \
\
then we can do git checkout into that backup branch we created and then see it in our logs. \
\
That is how we save a bad hard reset of a git branch.  \
\
confidence and money sorts out problems, imagine being the dude in a bar and paying for everyone!!!\
\
he then showed us a way not to bugger up others history of the commits.  Need to do that one again, finding it hard to work out.  \
\
Must women do not care about cock size and yes they do look the same after a while.  \
\
Be nice to yourself in your head.  Learn to love the parts of you that you don\'92t like.  Oh yeah and by the way, the supposed people you are comparing too are not even real.  Cam doesn\'92t tell the truth either.  The lighting, how it is zoomed etc.  \
\
Oh yeah, mentally I am not perfect because of the nice tired feeling i get from the gym is in short supply right now.  Know that feeling will pass.  Accept yourself, warts and all.  The world does need more love.  Love is all you need.\
\
camera is fantasy,  the big screen is an illusion.  Tom Cruise, prime example. \
\
Ok this is going on to a more complicated example.  This is imagining that we are working in a big team together and we need to undo the commits that the other members of the team have pulled from.  So This involves undoing without changing the history.  Sounds complicated.  \
\
Git revert uses new commits to overwrite or revert  the previous commits.  it doesn\'92t undo the previous commits, it makes a new commit that undo\'92s the changes from the previous commits.    \
\
Git revert uses previous commits into the new commits.  It is not going to modify or delete the existing commits we have made, instead it is going to place new commits on top of those that completely undo all of the changes from the previous commits so our history remains intact.  \
\
he starts off again with git log.  \
\
If people are not nice to you it is because they have an insecurity that they are putting on to you.  Joe Rogan has said that many times.  \
\
then with the most recent log commit we take the hash (history number) and do a \
\
git revert with the hash number, up comes a temporary message and a editor.  \
\
save that and exit out of that.  \
\
It now has a new hash number on top of the previous hash number history and if you refresh the file in your editor you will notice it has gone back to the previous state before the changes.  \
\
now if you do a git log and a git diff with the two hash numbers of the wrong commit and the new reverted commit you will see the difference between the two.  \
\
Even reading the differences I think it will take a while to decipher because it is not obvious what the original commit was, it only seems to have the revert commit by saying in red it took out the functional change and put in the original one shown with a green colour. \
\
Ok i was getting confused there and i still have one question.  In our local machine the history does seem to change with the different hash numbers.  \
\
If you look closely at the git log you will see in the revert commit (when you get around to doing it) the message below that it reverted the hash number of the previous commit in that branch.  Even though The revert itself will have a new hash number.\
\
So our local history has changed, however when it comes for others to pull that change from GitHub their history will not be corrupted.  However, it still remains the question though do we have to tell the team to do another pull request, i think i will?\
\
I say this because what if they have pulled our commit before we made the reversion, surely they need to pull again.  This might be covered in Corey\'92s advice when merging with the master, we do a final pull before we push the commit.  \
\
this video is showing us about the git stash command\
\
he said this is useful when we have made changes that we are not quite ready to commit.  Does this mean we can stash them away for later?  Certainly sounds like it.\
\
yeah it is, you save these changes in a temporary place if you need to make some reversions or you know these changes that you have just done will come in later.    \
\
While this is in my head, i think i will find this out when i start using git consistently for projects, but i am thinking that you do commit then push, but maybe not.  Maybe you do a whole range of commits and then push when you think you are done.  Because to undo the problem of committing to the wrong branch I think is just at local level \
\
Trying to remember the method:\
\
it is git reflog you take the most recent log, with the hash number, you then do git checkout on that hash number, you are in a \
detached head state. then make a branch then do git branch again and then checkout on the branch you have just created, then do a log and you see you have successfully, got the data over to the right branch.  \
\
you can then delete the branch that had the wrong information in it.  \
\
Ok a few things still to get in my head.  The protocol seems to be that you can only use the git cherrypick if you haven\'92t pushed the wrong branch to GitHub.  \
\
so say we find ourselves putting commits locally to the wrong branch.  Here is what we do:\
\
\
\
we do git branch\
\
remember the the git checkout on the file name to bring it back to normal, this only works if you haven\'92t committed the file, correct and puts it back to the original state.  \
\
to bring back a commit you do git log and then do a git reset \'97soft or medium on the commit history has before the committed hash.  \
\
That will undo the commits.  \
\
\
ian techn ology:\
\
Loopback adapter,\
\
realtek wifi.  \
\
hardware wizard hdwwiz.exe \
\
git clean was the d and the f option.  the d gets rid of any untracked directories and the f is to force through the clean.\
\
The message, working direcotory clean, might not be a bad thing to be in.  \
\
The manifestation of seeing one change happening in one branch and the same occurrence happens in another especially if i took the hash history to put it in the new branch after realising i was in the wrong one seems to happen because branches do not have first preference, only the master does.\
\
So an experiment to do for tomorrow is do the changes in the master branch, then move those changes to another branch then do a hard reset in the master branch and see if the files are still there in the other branch.  The jury is out on that one. Nope it works.  \
\
the difference between git log and git reflog \
git log is used from cherrypicking and most of other things even git revert.  On the other hand, git reflog is to undo the deletion of files that you find out you really need.  To undo the file deletion you get the reflog hash before the deletion and then you are in a detached head state, you then make another branch from the detached head state\
\
you then checkout the new branch you have created and do git log and the reflog data from the branch that you deleted the files should be recovered in the new branch.\

Hit "esc" then type ":wq" and hit enter to save your choice. Viola!\
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs262 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 The trick here is to actually physically type \'93:wq\'94 after escape to get out.  \
\
Ok I think i am well schooled to move on now, however lets do a recap.  \
\
first things first, mofdified a file but don\'92t want to add the changes, just do git checkout on the file and it goes back to its previous state.  \
\
to undo a file move from the staging area do a git reset.  \
\
to undo a commit do a git log\
\
and take the hash before the commit and  do a git reset soft, medium or hard to take it back to the previous state.  Check status before and after you do this.  \
\
amending a commit:\
\
after you have done an git commit -m and realise the message was wrong you just do a git commit  - - amend -m \'93with the new message\'94\
\
done and done.  \
\
if you also realise that you didn\'92t include the correct files\
\
you do a git add then do a \
git commit  - - amend hit enter\
it will take you to an editor with the same commit message, you come out of that with escape :wq\
\
and then do git log and you will see that it has the same commit message and then you do git log - - stat and you will see the files in that amended commit and i think it gives a new hash function.  \
\
after that we have realised we have been committing to the wrong branch, we have been doing the master rather than the project branch.  Good to keep a file visual here. \
\
so what we want to do is to take the committed files from the master, move then over to the project branch and then remove the commits from the master branch.]\
\
this is how it is done :\
\
git log\
\
take hash of the recent commit.\
\
do a git checkout to the project branch\
\
do a git log\
and will see there are not commits, do a git status too just to be sure,\
\
then do a git cherry-pick with the recent master hash number and the details will be uploaded to your project branch.  \
\
then do a git log and status to make sure, \
\
(by this time you will have a visual in finder that the files have changed over)\
\
you do a git checkout master to get back to the master.  \
\
do a git log and take the hash from the previous commit (the commit that has the original state)  \
\
and then do a reset soft, medium or hard depending what state you want to get back to.  \
\
soft will revert the files back to the stagey, medium, unstaged, hard  completely gone but for the untracked files, and finally a git clean -df to get rid of all files, including the untracked files.  \
\
do a git log and you will see you are back the previous commit state and all is good.  the visual on finder will show no files in the master branch but the files remain in tact in the project branch.  \
\
oh aye to take git out of the equation in the working directory we do \
\
rm -rf space here.git  (remember the space and the file name)\
\
so that pass the commits to the proper branch and deleted the ones from the master.\
\
What if you then realised, \'93oh shit i need those files i deleted from the master branch\'94\
\
how we sort this is the reflog.  The ref log reference every step you took rather than just the commits of the general log.  \
\
it is the garbage heap, you have 30 days or so to act on this if you want to recover any data.  \
\
so you do git reflog \
\
and you take the hash step before the deletion took place or the state before the delete state happened.  \
\
you then checkout on that hash, you are now in a detached head state.  \
\
you then create a new branch to hold this detached head state information.  \
\
you checkout from the head state into the new branch that you created, you do a git log and status and a visual from finder and you will see the files reappearing.  \
\
you have saved the deletion.  Now to get to back to the master branch where you wanted the information to be there in the first place you do a git merge origin master.  \
\
and then delete the backup branch  with \
\
git branch -d  (locally)\
\
and git branch - - delete origin backup  (remotely)\
\
ok last step now is revert without fucking up the history from my team remotely.   It is predicated on undo commits again but this time without disturbing the history of my team from my commits they have pulled.  \
\
the git revert makes a new commit on top of your old commit\
\
btw a straight copy of a branch can just be made if you create a new branch and checkout on it while being a branch with all the details.  \
\
back to revert.  The revert makes a new commit to undo the previous commits.  Cool so did that and i think i have finally got it.  \
\
you again do git log\
\
you take the recent hash number and do a git revert hash\
\
it takes you to the editor screen you make sure it is ok then escape :wq\
\
do git log again and it will show the reverted changes.  and takes it back to the previous committed state.  \
\
so now if you software team does a pull request they will only be pulling your revert push without fucking up their history, cool.  \
\
Hope to not use this often, but there you go.  \
\
to see what happened between the the previous commit and the new revert commit locally we just do git diff hash of the previous commit with the hash of the revert commit and it will show you what has happened.  \
\
\
now on to git stash finally.  As the name suggests it is when you have made changes but you don\'92t necessarily need them right now, you can stash them away from later.  \
\
right off the bat i think it is very similar to the detached head state as the stash is in a temporally place to pick them up later.  \
\
a wee tip there :\
\
git checkout - - .  takes us back to where we started from  \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs82 \cf8 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
I always used\'a0
\f7\fs78 \cb1 git checkout -- .
\f2\fs82 \cb3 \'a0to clear my working directory.
\f0\fs262 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \
\
git stash carry over from branch to branch. \
\
ok got the first steps, the first steps are.  You do a change in the text editor and save the changes.  \
\
you then do a git status and you will see the modified file, do a git diff and you will see the added functionality.  \
\
However it comes to your attention that you need to do something else before this functionality.  So the way round this is to park what you are doing and come back to it later.  This, ladies and gentleman is the stash concept.  \
\
we do git stash save \'93with an appropriate\'94 saved message hit return\
\
if we do git status and git diff we will see no changes are put forward and if we reload sublime we will see that it goes back to its original state.  However it is not gone, it is in the stash.\
\
we simply do git stash list  and the list of stashes come up, starting at 0 (must be an array).\
\
oh aye, i don\'92t think you need to refresh the sublime text, simply move the cursor over and it will change.  \
\
When it comes time to use the stash there are a few ways to do this.  \
\
we first do git stash list to see the stashes.\
\
then if we want to use a particular stash we do\
\
git stash apply and the array number of the stash.  The changes will come back, the status will tell you the file has been modified and if you move the cursor to sublime the changes come back what you did previously.  \
\
However if you do git stash list the stash is still there.  \
\
yeah that git checkout - - .  is cool to get back from the modified version quickly. I think it is the same as doing git checkout and the modified file name to get back. \
\
to use a stash and then dump it immediately after use we use this thing called a git stash pop.  \
\
pop will take the most recent stash, use it and then dump it from the stash immediately after it.  \
\
when you do more that one stash to use of later the most recent one gets the 0 array marker and pushes the less recent to the number 1 position.  In other words the most recent stash goes to the top.  \
\
so if we did a git stash pop it would put the section changes in rather than the black life matters changes.  \
\
so say we have been adding to our stashes for later use and the brothers from the other team deduce we don\'92t need this functionality, well we can do git stash drop with the array number we want to drop from the stash list.  \
\
this next step is only if you and your team are positive that you no longer need the functionality that you have stashed, you simply do git stash clear and it clears all the stashes on the list. \
\
Ok I think I have the stash down now.  Basically it is for functionality that you do not need right now, so you park it by putting it in a stash for later collection.\
\
so the file that has been modified and we decide to do the modification later we do:\
\
git stash save \'91with appropriate message\'92\
\
that will take the functionality back to normal and we can do git checkout - - .\
 and then do a git status and a git log and you will see nothing is going forward to the staging area.  \
\
we can add as many stashes as we want the most recent goes to the top and inherits he array 0 position cascading down etc.  \
\
use git stash list to see this array.\
\
to use the stash when we need it we have two options :\
\
git stash apply with the array number, tis uses the stash but also keeps it in the stash array.\
\
or we can use git stash pop and it uses and disposes of the most recent stash.  \
\
to drop one of the stashes after we have determined we do  not need it now it is simply a case of doing:\
\
git stash drop and the stash array number.\
\
to get rid of all stashes we do\
\
git stash clear.\
\
stashes are branch agnostic so if we find out we are using functionality in a wrong branch we can simply save that functionality as a stash and checkout in to the correct branch and then apply or pop the stash and you will have the functionality in the proper stash, this probably doesn\'92t apply to any commits.  This completes the lesson.  \
\
here we are just doing an overview of the git add syntax for the staging area.  \
\
I know the first one:\
\
git add -A is shorthand for all.  Done.  \
\
Ok the git add - A also included all the files in all directories even if you go down one directory.  \
\
so to use one specific directory we append that detail with the git add -A command so:\
\
git add -A myDir/\
\
done.\
\
git add -A is actually the default, so if we leave it off it will behave like it is there.  \
\
if you have deleted files that you don\'92t want to stage but only the modified ones you do:\
\
git add - - no - all and it will do that.  Again you can append it with a direcotory for that specific directory.  \
\
also you can do git add -u and it will add all the tracked files but leave the untracked files.  \
\
-u means update.\
\
again you can append this with the specific directory you want to hit.\
\
git add . is for the current directory you are in and included sub directories. \
\
whereas git add -A works for all files wherever you are.  \
\
I think i might like the git add .\
\
ah if files don\'92t come up in your working directory but do in git, it means that git only knows about these files.  \
\
do not use git add * (wildcard) because it is a shell command not a git command.  Cool, it can miss files this way.  \
\
Hooray i think i am ready to begin finally.  \
\
back to Kevin.  \
\
In his sass folders Kevein is going o be making a bunch of different folders.  \
\
sass and scss has different syntax, scss is a lot like css whereas sass has its own style.\
\
This is interesting, kevin said that he does this for all his projects, so if i become the same, he said make a template and bring forward that template all the time.  I might just do that in the terminal now.  \
\
right so created a folder called project templates and copied the template over to my sass folder.    \
\
next video going to be doing the markup.  Ok it seems that cannot download or clone just one folder from a git hub repository.  \
\
they said there is this method called sparse checkout, but it seems still too many steps.  You may as well just download the whole repository and do a terminal move to your directory.  \
\
he said he likes doing everything with classes.\
\
he said he is going to have lots of containers on his site.  This has prompted a thought in my head about the legacy design versus new design.  The legacy design used containers too but it was explicit, in that it would be a blue or something background with the text contained within a border.  \
\
now it seems that not much has changed it is just the visual, but the techniques used are still very similar in that it instead of using a background colour to span the whole page they use a background image called the hero image.  \
\
however the text is still indented in much the same way as the legacy design.  It just doesn\'92t seem that way because the hero image spans the whole page, but there are inner containers for the text with no explicit border.  Hmm interesting observation.  \
\
he is going to use a flex box based grid system.   So anywhere he has columns he is going to need to use the grid.  \
\
he is talking about a container inside his grid container and when it goes down to the page it becomes a container outside the grid system, no quite understanding this, but it should make sense as we progress.  \
\
emment tricks \
\
training a div with an image inside.\
\
.logo>img hit tab done.  \
\
svg - scalable vector graphic, lets his logo stay as a vector.  SVG is the only vector image for the web.  \
\
the opposite of vectors are bitmaps.  Bitmaps simply describe what colour a graphc should be painted.  \
\
they seem to be highly suited to detail images such as a photograph.  whereas svg images are more suited for less detailed images that need to be scaled at different sizes like icons or data representations.  \
\
svgs seem to be more inherently responsive for different screes sizes and resolutions.  \
\
the trick is that a simple bitmap image can be too heavy for smaller screen resolutions or if they are connected to low bandwidth network.  \
\
so does this mean svg images work better for mobile devices?\
\
on the other hand bitmap images if they are light enough may be blurry on large screen formats.  \
\
also because svg are descriptor within an xml document it can be manipulated with css and javascript.  \
\
However creating these svg images is impossible because of the maths involved.  He did say adobe xd could do it.  \
\
kevin is going to be using a main nav and a footer nav.\
\
His argument for giving all his tags classes is because it gives them unique specificity as oppossesd to just using the tags.  \
\
However for me i think i will write the full tag with the class in css to make it easier to follow.  \
\
great emmet shorthand here for the nav list.\
\
ul>li*5  - i see the wildcard from bash being used here too, interesting.  \
\
you can also do,\
\
ul>li*5>a and you will get 5 list items with anchor tags.  magic.\
\
.container.grid for multiple tag names.  \
\
here is an emment chaining example.\
\
\
.hero-text>h1.title-large+p.intro and if you hit tab it will have the h1 and the p inside the div.  \
\
the difference between the + and > is the > means to be inside the parent tag, whereas the + means to come under the parent but not inside of it.  \
\
the chaining of the buttons classes with emjmment goes like this;\
\
a.btn.btn\'97secondary+a.btn.btn\'97primary  then hit tab\
\
ok he lets us into his technique in the mark up for using core style add ons like a button.  The button will de designed the way he wants all buttons then the two hyphens show that these particular buttons have to be designed differently.  That is the two hyphen rule versus the single hyphen rule.  \
\
in other words if you are modifying the default styles or adding on to the default styles then it is two hypens in the mark up, in theory it makes it easier to follow once we describe this is in the css.  \
\
\
he calls this a naming convention and to try and find a naming convention that makes sense to you.  \
\
if you get a job and end up working in a team, you will have to learn there naming convention too.  \
\
he is saying here about even putting containers in when perhaps it is not needed, because of future modifications possibilities, or the client could change his/her mind for example.  \
\
he said this technique makes it more maintainable in the long run, which is always a good idea.  \
\
he said the beauty of using flex box is that you don\'92t need to label col 1 2 or 3 etc because as long as the columns are equal width, you can get away with doing stuff like this (this being col without a number).  interesting.  \
\
he said flex box will work out the column sizes as long as the width is all the same size.  \
\
he said he should have made the middle images svgs rather than png, must be the scalable thing again.   \
\
the little z-index box he said be carful of giving it a name which  is text related because that text could change., I would call this section position element because you set the specific position.  \
\
this is the section where he is having a grid with no container.  I still don\'92t know why yet.  \
\
call to action before the footer he likes.  \
\
Kevin definitely has a style to his design, he believes in  the power of eye movement for design.  In that his hero sections always span the whole page and screen height.  However, he is aware to get the user to move the cursor down and not just accept that this is the whole content on the page he leaves a section/image just eating in to the bottom of the screen.  Leaving the user to go, \'91what the hell is that?\'94  piquing that curisiorty compels the user to move the mouse down and then the user realises, \'93hey there is more stuff down here?\'94  Almost like there are only privy to this discovery.  He does this all the time it seems.  He uses a very similar technique in the middle of the page to keep the user continuing to scroll down, almost like a design reminder.  I dig it and like it.  Good UX method.\
\
Ok lets crack on, exciting.   \
\
Ok tried to get the auto prefixes installed with node in the mac terminal, just so complicated.  I think i will have to settle for using an online tool and just copy and paste the answers over to my css file.  \
\
Tried again to see if it worked in the build folder, but it didnae.  \
\
the local versus global build i think is the global build is any directory in the terminal, the local is where you just run the package (GitHub package) in the working directory.  \
\
So browser prefixes are going to be a pain in the arse, you can use an online tool, but this is based on the assumption that you know which attribute needs to be prefixed.  \
\
back with kevin, we are at the footer right now, he said the icons he is going to use font awesome, which i thin k is enclosed with the script tags.  it is with the icon tag\
\
he mentioned something like normalise vs reset, something like with normalise the h1 tag style will look the same across all browsers, whereas with reset it will take that style out and do the browser own default style i think.  \
\
yeah i was on the right lines, a css reset is the shit i do at the start like\
\
*\
\{\
\
box-sizing: border-box;\
\
\}\
\
in that it takes the browser css defaults out of action.  So resets are useful and html doctor has its own rests you can use.  \
\
or you can use materialise which makes sure the resets all render the same on each browser.  kevin is using this.  \
\
the tech squid boy i listened to says to have the reset link above the custom css as you want the resets to load first. \
\
you can use the import tag but he said while that will work it is not as fast unless using a web pack package, which i think what i am doing with the gulp NPM packages.  \
\
I will use two link tags.  See what kevin does.  \
\
i used font awesome to get the icons, you just view their website and search icons, copy the i tag path and put the script in your body tag so it will render the icons for you.  You have to sign up to get their special script tag assigned to you.   It is a CDN not a CDM as Kevin said. \
\
Kevin has twitter and face book, i will replace them with linking and GitHub.\
\
This is good, a merge conflict is when say we have two branches project and markup.  Say there are changes happening to the same file Index.html from the different branches that creates a conflict.  \
\
You have to decide what changes from what branch you are going with.  \
\
Ok we are on to sass tomorrow, the variable set up, mixins and colours and fonts. \
\
Ok maybe a slight change of plan.  This video Kevin is showing us was back three years ago, it seems since then even he is using the terminal more.  He has a sass set up with gulp that lets him have his environment, this was a one year old video.  \
\
I will look into this now.  \
\
It seems for global use i need to prefix it with sudo for admin privileges with the mac.  \
\
Gulp has an autoprefixer.  But you can do it with post css too.  \
\
if you do an ! mark then hit tab with emment it will give you the html boilerplate.  \

jsx file extension i think is primarily react.  \

that stands for javascript extension.  \
\
ok i did some settings to the sublime work there i am using html css and js prettify.    To use this and this might apply to all packages, ah aye before i forget, the reason a package might not be avalibbe in sublime is that i have already installed it lol.  \
\
so in that list you pick package control and i think it is list packages and it will tell you what you have installed. \

\fs262 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 That above gives you the starting place to use it, however the documentation will show you that can enable this tool while editing and while saving as well.\
\
how i done that was go in to the tool menu and scroll down to the html, css. js pretty and then hover over it to where it gave me more options on the right and then i when down to the node path and it opened up the \
\
htmlprettify, sublime settings.  I bet this will be different for other packages, the documentation is where you will understand things.  \
\
the editing this is a pain in the tits, just do it with save, the changes.  \
\
a good idea when i have finally time to focus is to learnt he keyboard shortcuts and to get the best out of use with sublime.  \
\
learning to work your tools is a big advantage i think.  \
\
for optimising images, dev ed says tiny png dot com, takes the weight off the image without killing the image quality.  Yeah it seems good, i this it is only for jpg and pngs right now.  \
\
dev ed alo said something about a tool that changes the tags for you on the fly - i think it will be a little help but maybe not too much.  I will check now.  It seems it is just for vs code not sublime.\
\
I got side tracked with another tool he uses, placeholder dot com.  A place holder as the name suggests is take the place of the eventual text or image that will be for your website.  \
\
In that you don\'92t know it yet so you use a placeholder  instead.  It is just to give you an idea of the structure of the site and how it will look.   cool.  \
\
dev ed takes his own pictures might be something to think about.  \
\
A good idea is to look at the tools all the guys that i learn from for web development to see what they use.  \
\
cool, a way to keep up to date with node is to regularly view their website to see what long term support their version has and download that, it will update on to your terminal and will have the updated nom as well. cool\
\
view in the terminal by doing:\
\
node -v return\
\
and npm -v return\
\
we are going to be installing gulp now, keven starts off by saying that you should install the gulp cli first as without the command line interface you cannot run anything so gulp will be useless in that respect.  \

\f0\fs262 \cf0 \cb1 \CocoaLigature1 \
the above will install gulp cli globally.  \
\
man there is so much to this.  we do npm init - which i think means via the json file we are telling nodes package manage what packages we need for this project, no quite, i think that gets added when we tell it what we need in the development environment in the next step.    \
\
when we go through the series of questions for the json file you will notice that when it has your answers in brackets it is assuming that is what you want as the value to the json name.  \
\
a package.json file will be created with all the details you just put in at creation.  \
\
with that we set up our development environment with\
\
npm install - - save dev -gulp (this is to have gulp locally in only this directory)\
\
I got an error when i downloaded this.\
\
i was getting excited there, i thought - - print-path would show a way to get to all the folders but sadly no, it is just for the command line folders and files.  Otherwise known as Xcode.\

\fs262 \cf0 That will do for now, a little bit forward, nearly got my environment up and running.\
\
Ok back to the environment.  It has a node module folder, but kevin says you never need to go in there, it is just a view of what node has installed for you.  \
\
I think when you add a dependancy with node, when others download your project it also downloads these packages. I think.  \
\
I think it just dawned on me the autoprefixer is nodes, not as i thought post css autoprefixer.  It is first post css then autoprefixer.  Cool.  \
\
Ok like the instructions on that medium website, Kevin says to make a file in your root folder called gulp file.js.\
\
He calls gulp a build tool.  So we have to tell it what it is suppose to be doing.  \
\
 return gulp.src('./sass/**/*.sass') - this command looks first with the dot the current t directory and then goes into the sass folder and then any child folders and any files looking for the sass extension.  cool.  \
\
 return gulp.src('./sass/**/*.sass') the above is one big line as we chain it with .pipe() but kevin prefers to split that up with returns to make it easier to read. what you pipe through is the global variables you made at the beginning of the file, const sass, const gulp etc.  \
\
Ok wow, i worked that myself just fucking about.  First off, the catch to making a proxy server is to make sure the port for the proxy is free!  if it displays on the screen but the port is taken you can be sure that the browser sync will not work.  \
\
as the browser sync website says the proxy wraps the virtual hosting site and displays to the user that it it going through the port you created but i think behind the scenes the port is original set up.  For example mamp is on port 8888 so it does it functionality through there and the browser sync grabs it and copies it (if you like) and displays that functionality in the port you gave it to be free.\
\
I was so busy focusing on the favicon in the title that when it wasn\'92t there i thought that meant it didn\'92t work in that port.  Yes sure that was port 8888 and 8889 because both of these ports where taken, so it just outputted the site like a browser default localhost with browser sync without mamp, almost overriding mamp completely.  \
\
however with a free port it takes everything from mamp and sticks it in there, favicon and everything and tells you browser sync is enabled in the top right hand corner.  Brilliant.  \
\
the fav icon btw didn\'92t pop up because the real estate in the corner of the screen was getting less and less and i thought that meant the port wasn\'92t working - doh!!!!\
\
in future to see the fav icon keep the number of websites opened to a minimum. \
\
it seems that browser sync has a fav icon all of its own but that only displays when you have no virtual host and you are just using the default localhost and also with server:  rather than proxy:\
\
this browser sync is really good, it is all for development in mind in that if you are working on a part of your page and you do a change it doesn\'92t refresh back to the top of the page, it keeps your position.  cool.  \
\
\
ok he gave a tip when getting the extra stuff in like auto prefixes and post css, is when it says gulp.task\
\
use the function way but with very similar code design.   \
\
kevin recommends taking out the css file because that appears with gulp sass.  Then that would be your starter folder for future projects, what you do is just copy and paste and crack on with your next project, as it saves you from setting this up all the time.  \
\
i think i have got this to work post css and the autoprefixer.  The autoprefixer is like an inside package of post css.  \
\
So in the post css pipe we make and array of the post css packages we want in like this\
\
\
packages: [\
\
autoprefiexer\
\
]\
\
pipe(postcss\{packages\}) - something like that and then you get it all working.  cool i think.  \
\

the  "browserslist": ["last 2 version"] goes in the package json not the gulp js section.\
\
i will check now if you do git ignore for node packages.  \
\
Ok it seems that all you need to provide is the package json file and maybe my gulp.js file.  Leaving it up to the knowledge of the programmer to install the node dependencies.  Say in the read me section that it is important that you store the gulp cli globally first before using gulp if you have not done for in another project.  \
\
if i download a git hub repository that needs node npm dependencies then i should be able to load it back looking at the package.json file to what it needs.  So for example if i do the command:\
\
node then the file to run like index.js then there should be an error coming up telling me that i am lacking all these dependencies.  However because the package json file is there i should be able to  get it from there.  One way is to look at the package json file and figure out the dependencies through that, however as kirsten says that seems kind of cumbersome.  \
\
There seems to be another way via the CL.\
\
The package json\'92s job is keep track of all the dependencies this project requires in order to be operational.  \
\
so all you need to do (providing the package json file is available) is to locally do:\
\
npm install and the nodes package manager will install all the dependencies that you need locally.  \
\
after this is finished running it will have the json package lock file with all the node modules and the node modules file.  and now if you do the command at the start:\
\
node index.js (the file name the boy has given) it will now run that is only if you want something ran in the terminal, in the the node js is the whole point to use it.  Other wise it could be like my project in that i am just using the  node stuff for my development background.  Maybe i do not need my node stuff uploaded to GitHub for that reason.   \
\
this i think is turning out a great video - {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3NQIQqkTts&t=170s"}}{\fldrslt

\

\f0\fs262 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \ulnone   \
i think we are now going to learn how we ignore the node modules when uploading to GitHub. \
\
To do this is quite simple we do, in the .gitignore file\
\
###node modules####\
/node_modules\
package-lock.json \
\
a package json file gets created when we do locally NPM init (kevin) showed us this as well.   \
\
to get out of that yes no shite when it doesn\'92t want you to delete a directory we do N then escape key.  \
\
wrong you have to go through all the commits to get back to normal.  \
\
ok that was complicated.  Remember git has a cache, so if i upload a file at the beginning without using the git ignore file telling it to ignore this folder then it will never ignore it if i tell it after.  \
\
the way around this is to delete this folder from the gitignore cache  this is how it is done.  \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa300\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs120 \cf8 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
the\'a0
\f7\fs116 .gitignore
\f2\fs120 \'a0file was likely updated after that particular folder's contents were staged. To complete the circle, perform\'a0
\f7\fs116 git rm -r --cached .sass-cache/
\f2\fs120 .\
Also, you only need one entry for it in\'a0
\f7\fs116 .gitignore
\f2\fs120 ; preferably, one with a slash at either the front or the end to denote it as a directory.

\cf0 \
When you do this above step and then do git status it will tell you that a file is up for deletion.  You then add it to the staging area and then commit the changes and then pull the origin master and then push it and you will see it takes the sass folder out because it is now ignoring it. \
\
i am going to just do an experiment on that, i cm going to ignore the css then bring it back.  \
\
done the first step, now to bring it back.  \
\
yeah  got it.  \
\
ok if you fuck about wit any of the folders, deleting and bringing it back, you may have to run npm install again to get it to run. \
\
lets see what happens when i delete the css folder again.  \
\
yes when i delete the css folder and then do changes into sass and hit save it creates a new css file cool.  \
\
\
ok i copied the directory to make it like a template directory, kept it in mamp because i think that will be my developing environment.  \
\
i changed the main.sass file to shug.sass and it does create a css called shug css, but to display it, in the link real in the markup we have to make sure it is looking for css/shug.css\
\
*** remember i have created a project template in the htdocs, because i will always be using mamp as a virtual host ****\
\
\
The cherrypicking thing only really applies when you have already two working branches set up.  \
\
otherwise yes, if you do another branch while using the master then the new branch will inherit all the history from the master branch.  \
\
You only do cherrypicking when you have two branches set up and working on them both only to find you have been working in the wrong branch, then you do a cherry pick to bring it over to the correct branch and then revert the wrong commits back to right stage in the master branch.  \
\
kevin changes the normalize css defaults in the html part to;\
\
html\{\
\
font-family : \'93Roboto\'94, sans-serif;\
font-weight: 400;\
line-height: 1.6; - kevin thinks the default of 1.16 is kind of tight.\
\
 -ms-text-size-adjust: 100%;\
    -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\
\
\}\
\
importing google fonts roboto, 300, 400, 700, 900\
\
write this down so i remember for next time, to use google fonts we first go to the website then select what font we want.  In this case it is roborto - with that we select the weight classes, 300 is light, 400 is regular, 700 is bold and 900 is really bold, once i have selected them in the top right hand corner we will see a box with a red dot highlighted above it.  \
\
Select that box and a screen split will tell you your font family.  Now it tells you two ways you can use the google api, you can use it as a link in the mark up or as an import in your css files.  \
\
Import is always best so use that in the top of your sass file.  \
\
oh yeah i see how he made the css rules to specify, kevin did this because the google font site told him too underneath the import, it says :\

he put in font weight as 400 regular as well there.  \

weird, it seems the \'93down dash, this _\'94 prior to the file name like;\
\
_colours.sass when you do an import call in the sass file it still works if you do\
\
@import abstracts/colours \
\
in other words you do not need to do the \'93_\'94 in the import call.\
\
strange that this works. \
\
he said he sticks to rgba out of habit, i think it is to do with the photoshop platform.\
\
i think the 1 in the rgba a being the alpha part, 1 means 100 per cent.\
\
He mentioned the  copy and paste from photoshop sometimes creates a problem when transferring that to the html screens.  Something about quick copy he called it.  Maybe check this out before i move on.   \
\
his base folder and file is him not knowing where else to put them.  \
\
so he says if he needs a clear fix, he would put it in here.  \
\
left at the grid system, he was getting confused why there the logo and the header wasn\'92t going next to each other, it wass due to the mark -up being inside a container which he hasn\'92t set yet and the grid.  \
\
Grid tomorrow.  \
\
when do a save with the browser sync give it a second to catch up. \
\
need to check background linear gradient.\
\
Ah yes with photoshop and other programs like that when copy and pasting text over to the html it is called a soft return, however one of the consequences of this is that some times it brings over a transparent square box over with the text.  \
\
What seems to fix it is that the square in the html text in the editor seems to represent that the words are close together, so when you split them the square still does not go away, you actually have to delete a character and then bring it back for the square to go away.  \
\
\
cool. \

the linear gradient seems to be great for color blending which see;\

\fs262 \cf0 Again when he has problems or when things are not behaving the way he thinks they should he does background colors to see what is going on.  \
\
the order of the imports is important too in the sass folder, as it corresponds with the order of the css.  so if you import the header before the container then the the site is not going to behave the way you want it, as last entry takes precedent.  That really shouldn\'92t screw it up too much but if you have to do a change at a media query then it might because the order of the markup is not the same with the css.  \
\
it is kind of cool that he uses display :none like for his nav to temporarily take it away for design purposes, before bringing out back..\
\
He is parking the nav because he wants to make a mobile first nav.  \
\
he puts the max width in his base sass folder with his images.  \
\
he is going to merge the branches later when more work has been done.  \
\
\
so we have two branches loaded up with GitHub.  \
\
Right so we are on to the typography and the buttons.  \
\
He said that he would normally start doing this before the header and the containers, but maybe because that is all saved as a template, i don\'92t know.  \
\
mobile first design.  \
\
the last-child thing is  a tip from Kevin, and he says it is important not to get confused with last-of-type\
\
last child only works when there are two or more of paragraphs or headers together, last of type i think, \
\
it doesn\'92t need to be the child of the same element.  what i mean is i you have the following markup:\
\
<div>\
\
<h1>\
<p>\
\
</div>\
\
the paragraph is the last child here so there will be no margin bottom on it.\
\
However, if you make it last-fof type there will be both no margin bottom on the h1 and the p, because they are both the last of type of their element groups in the div, we don\'92t want that, just the last child in a div to have no margin bottom. \
\
It is to take out the default resets on the h1 and the paragraph elements.  \
\
That was quite good, i had a look with the developer tools and yes it shows that the h2 has a margin because it is not the last child, but the p underneath it with the box graphic shows no margin bottom, cool.  \
\
the is to make the design tighter kevin says to take out unnesscaery spacing, getting extra spacing from somewhere. \
\
he said there is a tip or trick that might makes your lives better down the road.  \
\
the line height you don\'92t need a  measurement like rem or em it is just 1.6\
done.  \
\
the buttons styling goes into the components sass folder.\
\
so he says the sass power is that you are not scrolling through a giant css file, you are picking out the pieces you want.  Could you not do that with css and just import the same things?  maybe not.  \
\
i think he likes to use sass the way i am doing it via the command line.  he is just teaching others that there is a software they can use if they don\'92t know cli keys.  Because prepose copies your  file and folder to the css folder unless you tell it to import in in sass before you make any changes to the file you are working on.\
\
For me i do not have these problems because i know how to use the command line.  It seems it is a good investment of my time.  \
\
the cool thing you can do with sass is if you have the same hypen leader like text then instead of writing out both ends of the hypens in separate lines like you would with css you can use sass\'92s indents to ascribe to them both like this:\
\
text:\
						transform: uppercase\
						decoration: none\
\
instead of writing\
\
text-transform: uppercase;\
text-decoration: none;\
\
cool.  \
\
&:not(:last-of-type)\
		margin-bottom: .6em\
\
this little trick of code means that whatever element it is tied to means (in this case the buttons),\
\
that not the last button, please give it a margin bottom, but the last button will have no margin.  Very clever, he is thinking responsive, so because it is only margin bottom, this applies when the screen gets tight and the buttons stack up on one another, you can separate this using that cool command.  \
\
The ampersand technique i think just applies to sass.  \
\
but with the indent you can keep adding little tricks to the class.  cool.  \
\
he is using tab in the responsive layout to see the hover effect, because it doesn\'92t allow you to hover.  \
\
the darker is again a technique i think only open to sass.  \
\
he said when you use uppercase with headings line height has to come way down, like 1 or if it gets bigger then smaller than one.  \
\
\
right no choice but to do Claire\'92s shite here.\
\
there are flex box playgrounds to reacquaint yourself with flex box.  \
\
Ok the power of indents is real with sass, the indents mean that the element is to be a child of the  class.\
\
the imports order it going to confuse me when viewing it  on the css folder.  I think i am beginning to see it.  A lot of it is set up.  The layout is where the order needs to be concentrated on.  \
\
Having said that the buttons are left to the end, i wonder why that is?  \
\
He gave a reason as to why he didn\'92t change the size of the links but rather did it with the father tag, which was the .main-nav tag.\
\
The reason he did this was say in a future nav tag you have paragraph text inside rather than link text (he couldn\'92t give an example as to why this would happen) then that ensures the text inside the nav (whether a link or not, would have the same size of text inside)\
\
So when i am building these websites concentrate on do i make the father the font size change or the child elements?\
\
again the code boundary guy (the c sharp guy) projects build, bugs and financial management app.\
\
put videos up in linked in when chasing jobs.\
\
so we are doing the hamburger menu.\
\
the overflow - such a good technique.\
\
The hamburger animation is coming from left to right.  So we can use the position value to move the nav item it the left so no one can see it by doing left: 100%.  and then say overflow hidden to take out the text that is left.  \
\
the subsituties the effect we want from the hamburger menu.  Done by javascript i think? - yeah i think it is, it is like the photo slider. \
\
comments in  sass will not show up in the css.  \
\
the hamburger menu goes after the nav menu, i thought it would be before but it is still in the container and the header section.\
\
nav-toggle is what you actually click on to make it appear and disappear.\
\
You have to make the cursor a pointer because it is not a link itself.  \
\
the padding displays the box with no text, always remember the power of padding.\
\
he still designs the hamburger himself.  and he uses the power of classes to make certain amendments to particular classes while keeping the core design.  \
\
check the content style with css to understand it.  \

\f0\fs262 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Kevin says if we don\'92t put in a content property then the pseudo element defaults to none, it means it doesn\'92t work.\
\
that is why we have to do content: \'91none\'92; \
\
it seems this is the case.  You can select a pseudo element with your mouse, it hangs out side the page.\
\
You can use images and icons to beef up your heading for example.\
\
block quotes are used for testimonials.  \
\
open and close quote properties seems so good for the testimonials.  See if the guy did it for mums dancing.\
\
when checking the ::before and ::after pseudo elements in chrome it actually comes up in the markup - which i will just check on my own because it is pseudo elements.  \
\
Yes it does.  \
\
No in my moms website he hasn\'92t done that, but he has empty quotes in the mark-up, which might be a similar technique?\
\
I was wondering with chris coy\'92s example.\
\
He only had one colon with the pseudo elements and not two.  But two is a css 3 thing.  One colon is legacy code but still works. \
\
As I thought, no content means an empty string = \'91\'92.  Cool.  Found what i was looking for.\
\
Yeah it is javascript to make the hamburger menu move.  \
\
do not do asyncs -defer, there might be some use.   Defer means to do the javascript loading after the html markup has loaded.  \
\
I think i am going to use the defer attribute to load my scripts.  Get the html loaded first then deal with the javasvriozpt. \
\
defer before src tag javascript.  It mimics putting it in the bottom of the body tag.  Awesome, feel better about it now.  \
\
it is written, \'91defer src\'92.  \
\
have to do a for loop when it is classes in javascript.  \
\
solved it good.  It made me feel good there.  \
\
opacity:0 is completely transparent, you can\'92t see, it disappears, like display none.\
\
The opacity definition in the english dictionary means the opposite of transparency, it is hard to work out.   \
\
ah i see, you canny do a display none on the pseudo elelmesnts.  Doh!!!  The reason for this, is that it takes it away from the html markup.  \
\
lets try that again, why is the x  to complete when it is display none?\
\
Ok i think i figured it out, the display none takes it away completely so the hamburger::after can move into the space vacated by the missing hamburger:: before.\
\
However with opacity: 0 the hamburger::before is still there but you can\'92t see it therefore the hamburger::after cannot move up one because there is no space to go.  \
\
the advantage kevin goes with the rgba method when darkening a hover effect is that say you want to change your color, the rgba effect will still remain with the new colour.\
\
That is pretty cool.  \
\
Kevin was embarrassed with himself because you should never put a hover effect on your list items because the user will think that those a re clickable,\
\
really bad UX design!!\
\
you get around this by using flex on the link tags, i will explain when it get back. \
\
Keep an eye on the order with the sass.  The indents with sass are going to be a pain in the ass!!\
\
Understand indents later when i am making dinner.  \
\
ok kevin said for his columns in the mobile he wants it to behave like bootstrap with the colums stacking on top of one another and then as the screen gets wider, have a 3 col grid system.  \
\
flex basis seems to mean you can set the length or the width of a column, pretty cool stuff.  \
\
yeah the col system is going to confuse me i think.  \
\
need to understand flex box more!!!\
\
If we bring the phone picture back in, will we see the flex-stretch then? and the text to be cramped? No, it didn\'92t work out that way. \
\
always remember the default for flex-wrap is no wrap in much the same way as my code in sublime.  \
\
again the background colour helps to see the container.  \
\
wow he knew right away that the h1 was flexing.\
\
he said something about when you flex something without the col flex attributes is that the headings can be almost construed as absolute positioning.  It loses its width from the display block.  Bummer.  \
\
He is creating a new column for the h1.  I think i am seeing it now.  If the father is a display flex then the childs have to arranged in a certain way for it to render properly.  So he doesn\'92t want the same effect for the general col so he is creating another.  \
\
ok on to the promo folder, i seemed to have made a mistake by inserting in too many columns, fucking pernickety thing this css!!!\
\
How did i follow him incorrectly? he must have changed something.  \
\
when he is doing a bigger site, he says he creates a separate pages folder, where each page has its own styles to follow.  \
\
it seems the Single Page Application follows the import method.  \
\
you can set google dev tools to the iPhone 6 screen size and then you can use the zoom function to really see the changes you made in that screen size.  \
\
he said he uses VH for the padding move on the sales points  section it is because when the user of an iPhone or an iPad changes to horizontal screen by flipping it over, the vh correspondeds with the screen from portrait to landscape i think.  \
\
yeah the VH does seem better, i did an experiment with 10 rem and the heading does seem to get further away from the margin as the screen changes.  \
\
man, again so pirneckity arrrrgh!!!!!!!  I am not a designer!!!!!\
no clue why it wasn\'92t the first child\
if that doesn\'92t work then do first-of-type - experiment.  \
\
maybe the first child doesn\'92t work, if it is wrapped in another class?\
\

\fs262 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 the selector below might be a way to access the particular child you want.

\fs262 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \
The above is the third child.  but if we put in :nth-child(1) then that is the same as writing :first-child.  \
\
I think the above technique will save me.  \
\
he is descining for  the small screen first.\
\
then deals with the larger screen sizes.  \
\
ok he seems to take his pictures out in the smaller screen sizes, he says they are not necessary.  \
\
remember margin: 0 and auto centres your div boxes.  \
\
transform might cause some spacing issues so just be aware of that.\
\
he says to actually test it on a phone - really?  you will only get one phone view but yes.  \
\
he says when he gets stuck on something, he moves on anyway, and ideas come for it along.  And if it doesn\'92t he says you are going to have to deal with it anyway.  \
\
ok the workflow is getting confusing.  wind the video back when i come back.  He is taking out his bg primary from the home promo section and putting in the base because it is a helper class and is always going to get used.  \
\
he then goes to the typography and under \
the .title-box class he appends it with:\
\
& + .bg-primary \{\
\
padding top: 8em\
\
\}\
\
find out what the plus sign means in css?\
\
ok, the plus sign.\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs122 \cf7 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
The \'93+\'94 sign selector is used to select the elements that are placed immediately after the specified element but not inside the particular elements.\
\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs262 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 This seems the best definition, however it wasn\'92t apparent the first time reading it.  It styles the sections from the plus sign after the element closes for example:\
\
<h1>Welcome to My Homepage</h1>\
\
<div>\
  <h2>My name is Donald</h2>\
  <p>I live in Duckburg.</p>\
</div>\
\
<p>My best friend is Mickey.</p>\
\
<p>I will not be styled.</p>\
\
then if you style it like this it will hit:\
\
div + p \{\
  background-color: yellow;\
\}\
\
the above ignores the paragraph\'92s inside the div however what it does hit the first paragraph outside the div, but no remaining paragraphs.\
\
lets try this out in  my styles. \
\
Yeah got that to work, it might confuse me, but i think i understand it.   \
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\cf7 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs262 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 it could be quite a useful thing to use.  He is using it in the context of after every .title-box div\
\
then margin top the  bg class underneath.\
\
he calls them base styles because they are used the same way all the time.  Specific classes go somewhere else.  \
\
watch the indents again, i don\'92t think an ampersand can be called from the left corner of the section, it must be indented and the corresponds style attributes must be indented too.  \
\
it is like a dom tree, indent for things you want to append under the classes. \
\
he thinks that while the call to action is a layout, because it gets used all the time and in most pages, he thinks it to be more like a component like a button, so he is putting it there.  \
\
again his knowledge on the file types for images is very high.  He said he deliberately kept it a jpg because you can manipulate them easier and can blend them easier too.  He said if he was to use a png it would have to have the transparency done at the beginning before taking it over from photoshop to the html.  \
\
He said while that might be more convienti to do it is a much heavier file, whereas if you use a jpg and then blend it with css it is a smaller file size.  \
\
he said the :\
\
background-blend-mode: multiply is not fully supported going too far back with the browsers.  \
\
It seems that multiply is the best blend mode with bringing a background colour with the image or you can bring two background images together, like this from w3 schools:\
\
#myDIV \{ \
  width: 400px;\
  height: 400px;\
  background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat;\
  background-image: url("img_tree.gif"), url("paper.gif");\
  background-blend-mode: multiply;\
\}\
\
ok there was no real definition of what the blend mode multiply is, but it seems to be the widely accepted one.  I think the technique has come from photoshop.\
\
found it, i was doing commas when it is not any commas! in sass.\
\
there is no commas in css either, it is spaces when you do shorthand, remember NO COMMAS!!!!\
\
they say syntax is not important, certainly is a pain in the butt!!!! \
\
yeah with his classes, for me i def going to put in the element type before the class so i know that it is a paragraph or header for example.  \
\
as i have no idea what this class is:\
\
.title-footer\
\
whereas if i do this:\
\
p.title-footer\{\
\
\}\
\
then that makes much more sense.  maybe i will change this now.  \
\
he is actually ok, because most of the typography classes are divs or unordered lists,\
\
but still for the smaller elements i am going to put it in.  \
\
we will return with the background image it is a svg logo so we use background -cover : contain and we put it in a pseudo element with positioning absolute after the father footer is positioning relative.  \
\
he said the margin size is to be relative to the font size, so if the font size is bigger then you don\'92t need as much margin top.  \
\
ok this is putting the background image with the footer.  he wants to put the logo in but with a lower opacity than the font of the footer.  He says if he puts the background image logo in the footer then, i think because it is an svg it means that if he lowers the opacity on the logo, it will also lower the opacity of the footer.  \
\
Kevin uses a pseudo element before to sort this.  I think i can see the use of pseudo elements now.  Because without pseudo lelemts to love this we would have to creates a real element like a div and put it before the footer.  \
\
I am starting to see the use of this, espescilly if it is just one thing that you need to do, then there is not point creating a div for that, just attach a pseudo element to do that job.  The pseudo element has no margin at all or anything set, whereas a div does by default ( i don\'92t think it does, it is just set to display block) so you would need to take that out.  let me just check that to make sure.   I am going to do the two examples and see if i can get anywhere.  \
\
pseudo versus div.    \
\
sidetracked here, but the front or the goblet style squat might be the way to squat and it strethen\'92s the teardrop of the thigh which is often neglected.  I remember that athlete that did a lot of barbell back squats had a acl damage while playing hockey because the muscle responsible for holding the knee together when you twist an turn (t	he teardrop) was weak.  Hmmm interesting.  \
\
back to the div vs pseudo, \
\
with using the pseudo i think he needs to make the father (the footer) relative, so he can make the pseudo div absolute.\
\
I don\'92t know if i need to do that with the div, we will see.  \
\
he makes the pseudo element a display block like the div would be by default.  \
with the position absolute, when you do the positioning, if you set everything to 0, the image or content will take up the whole space, like this:\
\
top: 0\
bottom: 0\
left: 0\
right: 0\
\
for logo\'92s always use background-size: contain rather than cover.  With cover the logo will cover the whole page but will be cut off.  it will be clipped.  I just want to check if he did that with the header.  \
\
he didn\'92t do that with the header, it was not as a background the logo with the header. \
\
background position centres it vertically and horizontally.   \
\
ok lets try this with a div before the footer.  \
\
it doesn\'92t work, like kevin said , when you changed the opacity it makes the whole content go light.  \
\
research more about pseudo elements.  you could do it with after as well.\
\
Ok i will try to do this still with a div.  \

\fs100\fsmilli50400 Since the pseudo-element is a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://css-tricks.com/a-little-reminder-that-pseudo-elements-are-children-kinda/"}}{\fldrslt \cf74 \ul \ulc74 sort of child}}\'a0of the parent, you can change the opacity of it without affecting the text content.\
To make that pseudo-element the same size as the parent, you\'92ll have to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://coder-coder.com/css-position-layout/"}}{\fldrslt \cf74 \ul \ulc74 absolutely position}}\'a0it and set its top, right, bottom, and left values to zero so it doesn\'92t collapse. Also, as a pseudo-element, it needs to have the\'a0
\f26\fs102 \cf67 \cb68 content
\f0\fs100\fsmilli50400 \cf66 \cb3 \'a0property set, otherwise it won\'92t show up on the page.\
(You can also put the background image into its own child element, but using a pseudo-element helps keep the HTML simplified.)\
Then for the text, which we have in the\'a0
\f26\fs102 \cf67 \cb68 <h1>
\f0\fs100\fsmilli50400 \cf66 \cb3 \'a0tag, you will need to set it to\'a0
\f26\fs102 \cf67 \cb68 position: relative
\f0\fs100\fsmilli50400 \cf66 \cb3 \'a0so that it will be on top of the pseudo-element and background image. If you don\'92t explicitly set the\'a0
\f26\fs102 \cf67 \cb68 position
\f0\fs100\fsmilli50400 \cf66 \cb3 \'a0property, it will be hidden underneath the absolutely positioned pseudo-element in the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://coder-coder.com/z-index-isnt-working/#2-the-element-doesnt-have-its-position-set"}}{\fldrslt \cf74 \ul \ulc74 z-index layer stack}}.\
Lastly, don\'92t forget to set the parent to\'a0
\f26\fs102 \cf67 \cb68 position: relative
\f0\fs100\fsmilli50400 \cf66 \cb3 \'a0to keep the child\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://coder-coder.com/css-position-layout/#an-absolutely-positioned-element-needs-to-position-itself-in-relation-to-a-positioned-ancestor"}}{\fldrslt \cf74 \ul \ulc74 within bounds}}!\
Now, the text will still be at a default opacity of 1, and the reduced opacity setting will be limited to the background image in the pseudo-element.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl580\sa405\partightenfactor0

\f13\b\fs112\fsmilli56364 \cf66 Alternative solution: add an overlay with reduced opacity and background-color on top of the background image.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa312\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0\fs88\fsmilli44400 \cf66 Another solution is instead of changing the opacity of the background image, you add an overlay with a semi-transparent background color on top of the background image.\
The HTML markup will be the same as the previous solution. In the CSS, you can set the background-image directly in the parent element, with no opacity change.\
The pseudo-element of the parent will then contain the semi-transparent background-color.\
This is accomplished by setting the\'a0
\f26\fs90 \cf67 \cb68 background-color
\f0\fs88\fsmilli44400 \cf66 \cb3 \'a0property using the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#RGB_colors"}}{\fldrslt 
\f26\fs90 \cf67 \cb68 \ul \ulc67 rgba()
\f0\fs88\fsmilli44400 \cf74 \cb3 \ulc74 \'a0syntax}}, where the first three characters are the RGB color numbers, and the last number is the alpha or transparency setting. We\'92re using\'a0
\f26\fs90 \cf67 \cb68 0,0,0
\f0\fs88\fsmilli44400 \cf66 \cb3 \'a0for the RGB color, which translates to black.\
An alpha value can range from\'a0
\f26\fs90 \cf67 \cb68 0
\f0\fs88\fsmilli44400 \cf66 \cb3 \'a0(0% opacity) to\'a0
\f26\fs90 \cf67 \cb68 1
\f0\fs88\fsmilli44400 \cf66 \cb3 \'a0(100% opacity). So our value of\'a0
\f26\fs90 \cf67 \cb68 0.25
\f0\fs88\fsmilli44400 \cf66 \cb3 will result in an overlay of 25% opacity.\
Here\'92s what that will look like in the code:\

\fs262 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Tried her method with a normal child div, still doesn\'92t work, you need a virtual div.  The article showed so much promise but ended up confusing the reader:\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs106 \cf8 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
You can put the image in the div:after or div:before and set the opacity on that "virtual div"  \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs262 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 The above is from stack overflow.  it seems you can\'92t do it with a normal div.  Moving on.\
\
it seems that when you use pseudo element for an svg transparent background it takes the child elements out of the flow and some of the links may not work then, so you have to set position relative in the child elements, still do not understand this.  \
\
the border box thing we do at the start, you actually have to set them for the before and after pseudo elements as well, because it doesn\'92t set when you tell the main elements to be set to border box.  \
\
ok it looks like there are three solutions to a pseudo code fucking up your clickable links.\
\
One is you set the anchor links father of the links that are not clicking to portion relative like:\
\
.nav-footer\
\
postion: relative. - i think this means it is relative to the absolute flow of the before element.  \
\
	a: these should now work.\
\
solution number two is put the z-index of the father of the the pseudo element to 0\
\
and then the pseudo element itself z-index to -1\
\
that will work too.  I think this works because it puts the z-index layer of the pseudo code behind the parent (which in this case is the footer), therefore the parent becomes important again and the links work again, the links are not part of the before pseudo element.  My only guess is that the before element footer doesn\'92t think the last unordered list is their child?\
\
and lastly and perhaps the  easiest is to make the psuedo element itself to pointer-events: none and that works too.  \

oh aye a boy said that by using opacity, it effects the z-index layer too!! \
\
ok we are on to vmin and vmax units in the next video with Kevin.  These viewport min and viewport max seem to be aligned so when the user filps their mobile phone from portrait to landscape the page stays together.  Interesting.\
\
on to a tutorial video about vh, the screen size fits into the viewport height of your device.  cool.  Not entirely true, if the mobile screen can\'92t fit the content in it will spill over the screen so watch that.  He said to use media queries to sort that a side note is you can maybe use vh or vw in the padding as well so maybe save that little bit of space before you have to change it with media quires.   \
\
the difference between percentages and vh and vw.\
\
if you do width a 100% it will only stretch to the far end of the parent container allows, same for height. \
\
whereas even if it is a child element, using vh or vw, the parent dimensions will be ignored and t goes to the whole screen width or height.\
\
yeah the vmin and v max seems weird. \
\
that seems interesting?  But i have never seen him do this.  you can use vw on headings so it becomes a responsive heading, so as the screen gets bigger so does the heading to accommodate for this, to stay in proportion in the page. hmm and it gets smaller to as the screen gets smaller.  \
\
he says while this might be good for titles it is not so good with paragraph text.  \
\
vmin and vmax seem posh to me, but he is going to use them in this video.  vmin i think looks at elements and if the other elements become bigger that your one, your element will stop what it is doing. weird.  \
\
wrong wrong wrong!  Nothing to do with elements, it is just the viewport - remember that.  so if the  view port width is bigger than the  viewport height, it will take over and vice versa. \
\
He has obviously experimented with using these measurements (vmin and vmax), and it seems he has come to a conclusion that the are no use for these while in a mobile/tablet viewport but as soon as it hits bigger screens there could be a lot of use, lessening the need for extra media quires.\
\
so say @media (min-width 925px)\{\
\
use v min.  \
\
\}\
\
\
he said you should be doing media queries on screen breakpoints not on devices, because obviously not everyone uses these devices.  \
\
Kevin hates to use many media queries, so he has a mindset, that if that will do but not perfect on a certain screen size but is is great for all other screens then move on.  Don\'92t just put a media query in for one little thing if you can help it. \
\
min height and min width could be really good to use.  \
\
the reason i wasn\'92t getting the same effect as him is that i had a 925 breakpoint of my text heading rather that 725.\
\
in fact i will just check that now.  \
\
i was wondering why he was getting a different effect than me, it is because he was fucking about with the viewport height with his mouse.  \
\
it just shows you that the software mistchook (stephan) is right.  The tutorials are just showing you, \'91a way to do it\'92 not, \'91the only way to do it\'92  which is why i need to build projects now.  \
\
Kevin is showing even with the best will in the world the order of what you think it is going to be set at, never really turns out that way in reality.  \
\
It is normal.  \
\
Here Kevin is showing how pernickety css is because when he changed the grid from the flow of the markup in one of the sections to help create a 50 % column in the large screen size, this also fucked the smaller screen sizes because the grid order in css comes later.\
\
You will never fix it all, have to start doing projects now.  \
\
done too pernickety!\
\
might be an idea to put the layout before the typography section.  Or more to the point, put the grid before  the typography, he says the grid is layout, i am not so sure.  \
\
The grid is a base in my eyes.  \
\
the + he was doing for bgprimary got fucked up because of that grid move in the mark-up.  \
\
fixed it, moved it over to grid and used the, \'91>\'94 symbol because it is a direct descendant of the grid div.  \

\f0\fs354 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \
background images seem to take out all the padding and margins and stretch the whole container.  \
\
It is still a trial and error thing with css.  Many solutions to the same problem.  \
\
problem again with the pseudo code\
\
when the positioning doesn\'92t work to cover the whole page\
\

\fs314 try width instead, i think i see the problem when you are doing before and after is that  you have to take them together as one like this and set the width:\
\
&::before, &::after\
			content: ''\
			display: block\
			background: $accent\
			position: absolute\
			width: 100%\
			border: 1em solid $white\
\
when you have set the width for both of them then you can then go and organise the margin like this for each:\
\
&::before\
			top: 0\
			bottom: -1em\
			transform: skewX(60deg)\
			left: -108%\
\
		&::after\
			top: -1em\
			bottom: 0\
			transform: skewX(60deg)\
			right: -108%\
\
I think the above method allows for the left and right positioning. \
\
i will check out the skew now.  No much to understand, just put it down to a technique that i pucked up, perhaps the others like the matrix and rotate will make sense once i see someone use it.  \
\
Again do not forget overflow hidden.\
\
That was a great tip, when you have a problem with the design, you can use the google dev tools first check the border box illustration at the bottom, that will give a visual image of the misbaveuere.  Then you can go to the 
\f13\b computed
\f0\b0  section and it will give values to all the css attributes that you have used and where it is getting used.\
\
In this case we did a position absolute  with left of 100percent so the nav toggle can drag it back the other  100 percent.  \
\
Of course when we went back to the full screen  we forgot all about this. \
\
When on cam move neck to the right if you are concerned about your appearance.  \
\
It is all about the build baby!\
\
Kevin is now talking about GitHub pages to host the site, he said something about jeckel, i will look into this, something about maybe getting it to be  like a php thing.  \
\
The step before that is to go over to settings and then scroll down until you get to GitHub pages.  \
\
In the GitHub pages section we choose the master branch or what kevin said create a  a GH pages branch.\
\
after you choose save it will say, \'91you current website is being built from the masters branch\'92\
\
You copy the title of your repository, that will be appended to the GitHub.io with a slash/\
\
you can even use the GitHub thing so it becomes a custom domain which is great. \
\
watch the knees when i bend down, keep the foot open, don\'92t go over the top.  \
\
obviously it isn\'92t a problem with the head thing, a women with big old titles wanted my boaby!!! \
\
Just had a look at Kevins code, it seems to do the same thing.  \
\
fixed it, well a kind of fix, just change the transition\'92s speed about 100px sooner. means that the flaming with the hamburger menu stops, the only consequence of this is that the speed at 650 px for a 100 px or so is a bit fast to go to the menu, but no big deal.  \
\
changed it to 690px, only sacrificing, 30 or so pxs good.  move it up to 700, so good.  \
\
remember to empty the cache and hard reload when doing changes to the git hub host.  \
\
yeah i think this is it, this tutorial is going to be building a portfolio site, just what i need. In the end I will maybe just change the pictures a little bit, but keep it essentially the same.  \
\
The way i am thinking is build this, and then seek a video on designing a portfolio site from scratch with adobe xd.  \
\
Then use the markup that i already created with kevin, to change the design.  \
\
kevin shakes his head from left to right, depending on what he is thinking.  Visual to words i think.\
\
He never keeps his head straight, nothing to worry about.  Us humans are really idiosyncratic.  \
\
Omg he has actually design this with adobe xd, cool.  \
\
when i am starting a new GitHub repository i have to create from GitHub. \
\
There is a step though to do it locally like this after you have made a title in GitHub like this:  You have to commit the changes locally to get the master branch ready.  \

\f23\b0\fs115 \cf80 In websites, an overlay is graphical content box that appears in the middle of a page, obscuring the background content.

\fs194 \cf0 the img default positioning is inline block to have the images side by side, so when it is a mobile screen there will always be a space because there is no line break with display inline block, so for mobile screen change that to display block and that margin will go away.  I thought the inline block would do that side by side automatically, but it seems not.    \
\
when we go to the bigger screen sizes we don\'92t really need the max width property in the containers, just the images really.  \
\
i thought that by putting the images back to display inline-block that the images would be displayed side by side in the bigger screen.  That didn\'92t happen, i do not know why, maybe something to do with the parent element or also could be to do with the relative positioning of the images, who knows.  In fact i will fuck about with the chrome dev tools.  \
\
Yeah fucked about with them but no it seems display block with float left is what makes it like the li item inline block.\
\
We might not be doing floats here because of grid and flex box.\

\
doing a form now, i wonder how this works with no php? \
\
i don\'92t think i knew this is that if you put an input tag inside a label tag they should begin to work together, in that if you click the name label on the browser screen it automatically goes into the input box, he calls it working the way a label should.  lets see.\
\
input type \'93email\'94 so it knows to look for special characters.  \
\
he said he doesn\'92t do a lot of contact forms.  \
\
he says he doesn\'92t use placeholders because he thinks labels are better practice for screen readers and stuff like that.  \

he says even though they don\'92t look as good, try to use them, for accessibility reasons.  \
\
think of div as the grouping box in adobe xd design\
\
i don\'92t know why he didn\'92t use font awesome icons?\
\
he uses a lot of classes so when it comes to the css he knows exactly what bit he is styling for.  \
\
he does try to examine the design of the product and decide then and there if he needs to a class on a paragraph for example, if it really looks different from the others then yes he will use a class.  \
\
I am beginning to see his naming convention.  If he starts with  a section like, \'91about me\'94 then all the corresponding classes have the about me-but appended if the right information like  - about me img, about me heading, about me, desc, etc etc.  \
\
good.\

Is this where the portfolio items are going to go?\
\
this is the definition of  portfolio module i could find on the net:\

\fs164\fsmilli82400 \cf83 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sa345\partightenfactor0
\cf83 \cb3 The portfolio module can be used for displaying a selection of creative work or products that you want to promote. For example if you have a range of photographs that you would like to display in one place you can use the portfolio module to do this. Your photographs or images will be displayed in a list of thumbnails with short descriptions. Each item will click through to its own individual page featuring a larger image and more detailed description. You can also display your latest image or product on the homepage using this module.\
This module can also be used as a case study module with a list of case studies linked through to individual details and images. The most recent case studies that you add are also displayed on the homepage of your website so that visitors can click through to them that way. This module enables you to show in-depth client work examples and industry articles in a clear format that promotes what your organization is doing and displays your knowledge of your industry.\
\
Ah i see, this design is the portfolio module design- where are the different projects are kept together.  \

\f0\fs284 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 The other folder  is going to be called the partials folder, is this the same as, base?  No it seems to be the layout folder.  \
\
I finally found out what the underscore means in the sass convention, the underscrore means that it will be imported and not to create its own css file.  \
\
That is why the main.sass doesn\'92t have un underscore in it.  \
\
he has an all file so he can then go into the main sass folder and do an import all.sass to import all the modules because the all file already has the import typography and coulouyrs in it.  \
\
when you are importing files it is inverted commas after the @import, when you are doing folders then files then no inverted commas is needed.  \
\
he is using vs code now after playing along with atom.  \
\
still not sold to me yet, i think i prefer sass rather than scss.  \
\
he loads in his google font into the typography.  \
\
The bigger projects he said maybe make the variables more exact like, $pg-one_heading-style etc\
\
he is short handing the font variables, almost like david copperfiled short hand.  \
\
Like $fw - is font-weight. \
\
he regularly uses the variable accent and this is why:\
\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs194 \cf0 accent colour definition seems to be additiantial colours, not the dominant colours but ones you use sparingly to breath new life into the dominant colour.  It is to make the website interesting.  For example the dominant colour is black and the accent colour is orange, the accent colours may be used to focus the eye and to bring the site to life. \
\
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0

\fs284 \cf0 This helps to understand the variables from him.  He says that you will often see this type of variable convention and he has used this before as well, although he is going to change this now:\
\
$text-primary= $grey\
$text-accent=$accent\
$text-secondary=$light-gray\
\
so again he says if it is a small project this then variable convention is overkill.  \
\
he says you can do that in the typography as well, extending to fonts for various sections, but he said this will be overkill of this project\'92s size. \
\
he says you can taylor make the  normalise  folder if you want, just amend the screen shot thing when you download it.  \
\
yeah in the normalise he is not afire to change the values, like for figures he doesn\'92t need a margin, so he is taking the normalise out.  \
\
ok i was going a bit crazy there, it seems when you make the changes to the normalise.scss file, when you do the changes, you have to save it at the main sass page because the css is looking for the sass extention not the scss extension!\
\
so in sass i don\'92t actually need the inverted commas for the files, it must be a scss thing.  \
\
he said some people make their own base folder, but he said his base is his own partial in the way he likes to work.  He encourages to find your own system.\
\
he try\'92s to have an all file for all of his folders, but he doesn\'92t have one for the vendor folder because normalise is going to be the only vendor.  \
\
base styles hs says is all the styles you out on your body.\
\
line height is like that of microsoft word.\
\
Again he says some organise it alphabetically, but he just does it as he sees it, no rhyme or reason how he does stuff.  \
\
he says setting the background in the body to a colour, say white can prevent problems.  He says he hasn\'92t seen any problems, so I don\'92t know why this is used, but it is only one extra line of css.\
\
3.125rem is 50 px (have a calculator close by)\
\
he is using rems to work out the pixel sizes.  88px is 5.5rem\
\
16 times 5.5 = 88 \
\
Press space after assigning the variable to avoid the automatic fill in.\
\
serifs and sans serifs difference is the the points design after the letters.  Like the times new roman is a serif because it has design in the letters.  Monterast is a sans serif because it has no points in the letters and it typically darker.  \
\
yah dick I put in a pound sign instead of a dollar sign!!! lol. \
\
\
With the mixin you do not have to put the arguments in, if they are to remain the same, only if you want to add or change the argument value.  Like here is the mixing i created:\
\
=sans-serif($fs, $ls: .3em, $colour: $gray, $tt: uppercase, $lh: 1)\
	font-size: $fs\
	letter-spacing: $ls\
	color: $colour\
	text-transform: $tt \
	line-height: $lh\
	font-family: $ff-ss\
\
so when i call this mixing\
\
with +sans-serif(if i want to change the letter spacing i do this - $ls: .2rem, but if everything else is to remain the same then i need no arguments because it will fill this in by default)  \
\
which i will just check.  \
\
yeah mixins have the potential to be excellent, if i just want to change a value, i just do it through the mixing.\
\
It doesn\'92t seem to matter what order the arguments come in, which is handy.  \
\
the star is the universal selector.  It seems he hasn\'92t used box-sizing: border-box in this after empathising through all his videos of how important this is!\
\
I will put this in now. \
\
What is a flex box fallback? I think it is so the older browsers pick up on it.  \
\
Why would you need a fallback?  I see, this video was created in 2017, probably does not apply anymore.\
\
He is mentioning object-fit, lets see what this is.  \
\
Object -fit could be interesting, it seems it is the same idea with background images but with a inserted image in the markup.  It seems it is all about protecting the aspect ratio, so rather than squeezing the pic into a small size, by using various properties css can tell the browser to cut some of the image off to preserve the aspect ratio.  \
\
Partials is as we thought, it is the same theory as single page applications, in that you do a little bit of css for one section, two section, etc etc and you import them.\
\
With SPAs you import markup for various sections, header, footer etc. \
\
again for the eye technique, here he is doing 80 vh instead of 100, so the top 20 of the next section shows up.  Of course you could always do positiong again.\
\
ok his reason for using classes is to use it somewhere else, if he doesn\'92t see a use of it anywhere else again, he will just nest it. \
\
Ok the components thing with react ties into the classes argument, in that if the project is so big, then you need classes or components that will get re used time and time again, but for smaller projects it is not worth it.  \
\
he is now thinking that nesting under certain circumstances may be easier to maintain.  \
\
consider the background images to be put in a mixin\
\
this seems to be the four stages for the background mixin\
\
\
background-image: url(../img/header-bg.png)\
background-repeat: no-repeat\
	background-size: cover\
	background-position: center \
\
assigning the minis to variables makes it easier to amend, local variables in the parameters help too, however, you have to put the variable values inside the parameters to tell sass what they are.  \
\
he said that it order to show the pseudo elements you have to display block or use position absolute.  You can inline block, but it fucks things up when trying to keep a break between the pseudo element and the real element.  \
\
i was forgetting the width/max width thing, still not quite got to grips for when I would use  both properties.\
\
anyway remember the pseudo elements are always relative to their parent elements, of course they are not if you put in position absolute with no position relative for the parent.  So when you do width 60% it is 60 percent of the container.   \
\
yeah he noticed the big space on the right too.  Kevin is good at that, seeing the problem with spaces right away.  \
\
Yeah the letter spacing seems to have  a default,\
\
it is amazing how display flex, flexes the images down too.  \
\
Just after saying this about the images flexing, he is going to now talk about the object-fit, could be interesting.  \
\
Yeah it seems pretty cool to span out the height and width of the container you do this:\
\
.intro-left img,\
.intro-right img\
	object-fit: cover\
	min-height: 100%\
	min-width: 100%\
display: block\
\
A nice way to have transparent text with sass is color: rgba($white, .7)\
\
justify content centre again to fill up empty space could be an option in paragraphs.  \
\
yeah that is good.  \
\
He calls this a flex box fall back, that doesn\'92t seem like a backward compatibility thing.  \
\
It is he uses @support then grid, almost mimicking the same thing as flex.  \
\
He said you don\'92t need media queries for this.  I will look into this later.  \
\
Potency is useless after gym following a walk.  \
\
Ok grid has more to it that just simple columns, it even has more properties than flex box.  \
\
ok the grid seems to be looking at website in terms of a square.\
\
5 squares across and 6 rows down.  This got me interested, i wonder if the university website is done by grid.  I will just check now.\
\
Nope the university website is done with flex box, but it might be a grid in certain sections, maybe examine again one day.    \
\
Ok he doesn\'92t use the grid for building the whole layout site area, just the portfolio area.  \
\
grid doesn\'92t get rid of flex box, it is a tool we can use in conjunction with flex box.\
\
ok when you do display: grid, it shouldn\'92t really change anything because we haven\'92t set anything else up for it.  \
\
when you do display grid with height 100 per cent it goes to the height of the parent container, without the display grid and flex it wouldn\'92t do this.  \
\
He did confirm this that it does do the parent container.  \
\
sass does have a loop thing, maybe do that for the letter spacing?\
\
grid seems to take out the need for many divs, containers from dev ed.  \
\
something to do with the fr measurement - fr stands for fraction.  \
\
it is like flex box, it that the parent gets display grid or flex and then\
\
you can access the properties of it like\
\
grid-temp-row : first values here are the rows\
\
grid- template-col :  same as above except for column.  you can enclose them in the repeat bracket.  \
\
I wonder if chrome has the grid layout like firefox?  \

\
it seems the be the big container is display flex, but the smaller container is display grid and then the individual items are grid properties.  \
\
the span name seems to be good, but this is in the individual items so like\
\
grid row span 1 - go over one row.  \
\
grid row span 2 - go over two rows\
\
rows are horizontal, columns are vertical.  \
\
Kevin likes to fuck about, he is doing it again with the backgrounds.  The pseudo elements seem to work best when wanting to manipulate the background images.  \
\
Ok first impression, it strikes me that it the grid is not essential, it seems to be another technique where you have to fuck about to get things to set up right.  No different from the other techniques.  Like anything, i think you have to have a deep understanding of the concept before you can manipulate it to your adavantage\
\
ok you can use backward capability with grid - why would grid be used, i thought it was new?  \
\
he says there is an older version of the grid.  \
\
i think the min max in the grid is telling the site not to shrink below a cetain number, i am going to try something different with it, in dev tools.  \
\
fucked around there, seems to be just affecting the paragraph container.  \
\
ah ha, the grid template columns i think respond the number of columns you want but the info you put in with spaces.  Here is what i am thinking before i try this out:\
\
grid-template-colums: content (this would be 1 column spread out the page)\
\
grid-template-colums: content content\
(this would be 2 columns spread out the page)\
\
grid-template-colums: content content content\
(this would be 3 columns spread out the page)\
\
ok lets try this.  \
\
the auto in the minmax(function) makes sure the content fits.  \
\
the middle column has the threshold the other 2 are just fractions.  the middle column the paragraph one are saying do not expand to fill out the page until the vw passes 30em pixels.  \
\
interesting.  you can use supports for so many things, you can even have a float fall back.  \
\
if the browswer doesn\'92t know what at supports is it will just ignore it, so no harm done and use the flex that you have.  \
\
the grid is not a media query solution but it enables us not to use as many media queries.  \
\
Ok he talks about grid-template-areas.  \
\
He says they are great but because we have overlapping areas in this case that is not to going to work.  \
\
Need to research this, will now.  \
\
I think it is a simple as setting the template.  Instead he said he is going to be using grid lined names.  \
\
Again he mentions like dev ed did, that when you use grid, you don\'92t need a whole bunch of divs.  \
\
He is now talking about a flex box fall back, and says it probably will not work very well.\
\
because again i think of the overlapping thing he wants to happen, he said he might have to use a fallback with floats.  \
\
he says that the reduced markup he is using means that he needs to use floats more.  he said this is funny as he thought he was done with floats.  \
\
Ok this might be cool, we are going to be doing placeholders now.  \
\
he said we are going to start with the grid.  Ah right, i think something just downed on me.  The gird wasn\'92t the fallback, the flex box was lol.  At supports means if the browser supports this, please do this, if it doesn\'92t then use flex.   \
\
so on to the next section because again we want it to use gird first we do this support thing and then use i think floats to fallback on.\
\
strange.  \
\
he is starting with the supports here, but wouldn\'92t that cause problems with the css nature in that the last entry takes precedent?  so if you are going to be doing floats as the fallback in this scenarios is that going to work instead of grid?\
\
christ supports seems to be like an autoprefixer.\
\
Ok i think i am seeing when a container is needed, it is when the images and text are going right over to the edge and you don\'92t want that.  Cool.  \
\
ok he says that placeholders are similar to mixins but they can\'92t except arguments.\
\
He says the @extend is sometimes dangerous, however, when you are calling just once thing like a placeholder it should be ok.\
\
I will check what this is, the extend i mean.  \
\
For the gym still to try.  Put the bar further back, this means you can\'92t stay as upright, but hopefully the pleasant consequence is you don\'92t need to do as big as a hip shift.  I want to avoid the compression on the left kneecap and the bruising on the extension on the way up.  \
\
also try the feet pointing out cue with the deadlift.\
\
can\'92t seem to get the hormone kick with this new diet, i wonder what is happening? - Yeah i think it is the lack of water that the minimal carbs give in the keto.  It seems i do continue to get stronger but without the good feeling from that stretch, the muscle doesn\'92t seem to swell well either, and because of that i am feeling it on the ligaments.  \
\
Back to extend.  \

\f3\fs110 \cf4 \cb3 \'a0directive, you do not need to specify several classes for an element in your HTML code, like this: <button class="button-basic button-report">Report this</button>. You just need to specify .button-report to get both sets of styles.\

\f0\fs284 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Composition in web development terms means how the website is structured.  \
\
Granular is how specific (add small grains to ge the desired effect)\
\
BEM - stands for block element modifier.  \
\
The article i am reading is suggesting this is a different method than chaining, it is also a naming convention.  It is to avoid nesting, nesting is not BEM.  It is to encourage flatness in css naming convention and to help with media queries.  \
\
i am going to find out what class chaining is BEM, they are the same, it is Just BEM has a more sophisiticed naming convention.  It creates single responsiloty.\
\
Ok i am thinking I am seeing the difference between extend and BEM.\
\
The aim to be similar in that they want to flatten  the css code.  However one, BEM bloats the html (and arguably the css), and extend bloats the css only.  \
\
I think Kevin said extend is dangerous to use because debugging extends can become a nightmare because there is no BEM in the html.  \
\
So if you say extend a container, you need to find where the fuck that container is, because it is not in the html.  \
\
BEM is more simple to follow, however nesting is not BEM.  \
\
BEM and extend can be used in conjunction, although most web development projects pick a convention and stick with it at the beginning.\
\
I think i would only use extend for one thing.   \
\
still to check placeholders for sass.  \
\
this dude is saying that placeholders are like mixins without the parameters as kevin said, so that would mean it is a constant block of code. So it seems that placeholders can add a block of code to the class defined in the html.  \
\
So i think even though you might call the sasss extension %container - the percentage sign is very important here.  When it comes to parsing the css you will not see anything representing the class - container, but instead see the block of code that was made with the extension container in another class, interesting. I think that is right.  \
\
the extend when it renders on the css seems not to repeat itself, like a mixin would do, however, i will see how you read this when you add block of code to a class i addition to the block of code made for the extension, or placeholder.  \
\
it seems the best way to use extend  is with placeholders.  \
\
Yep as a deduced, you don\'92t have to add anything to the markup, just extend it anytime i need to use it.  \
\
he moved the placeholder before the @supports, because he wants it to be used irrespticive if the grid is supported or not.  \
\
you can use line names in the grid layout per row and per column so agin you can manipulate them.  You can use numbers for this too, but Kevin says they are a pain in the butt, yeah probably for get what the numbers are.  \
\
Ok just looked at that grid i made at the bigger size, i thought it would respond, it didn\'92t, well that is not strictly true, the child elements didn\'92t respond with it - Perhaps Kevin will mention this, but that seems shit right now.  \
\
i think it might have to do with the min max criteria, it seems to fit and respond fine when the screen gets smaller.  \
\
When you put auto in the min-max, especially in the max side it means that when content is added, the row will not be cut off, it will accomodate the content and keep the same size of the columns in the rows.  \
\
While the grid is responsive, the image doesn\'92t seem to respond in kind.  I hope kevin can query this. \
\
Ok justify self : stretch seems to work, however, if the image is a small one, or a narrow one, it loses its potency.  \
\
Yeah, width works better if it is small image - put width to 100 percent and you can get away with it, although it still isn\'92t perfect.  \
\
the difference of max-width and width in images is that, max-width is telling the image to span the max of its own width.  when you say width 100%, it tells the images to span the width of the container even if it can\'92t do it normally.  \
\
Man after all that, at least i saw the problem.  I thought i had the code wrong and he had it right, turns out he was moving the mouse to get it to fit in the screen size.  It doesn\'92t fit at the small screen, to my little margin fix would have done it \
\
remmember agin Kevin is not perfect, and it shows how pernickety css really is.      \
\
Also the mobile views in chrome are not perfect, you shouldn\'92t be able to move the screen.  \
\
To fix the heading getting cut off at the small mobile screen, he is talking about making the font lower.  \
\
I think the rows get put in automatically in the grid, depending on what parent you put the grid to.  \
\
Omg, after all that - make sure to empty the cache if something is not levelling up, that was ridiculous.  Everything was the same it just didn\'92t look like that. I am going to check the margin auto now.  It seems when doing little changes to the margin, it doesn\'92t fully come up without doing a hard refresh and getting rid of the cache.  \
\
Is the extend a little buggy?  Nope, noting to do with the extend, it is the way the small screen on the mobile 5s is displayed.  Watch for the mouse movement, it seems it doesn\'92t centre it.  \
\
also do the hard core refresh!!!\
\
so fucking annoying.  \
\
I have think i have came up with a cheat to reset this - if you have a main container that has a width property, take the width out then the small screen will centre again, then put the width back and it should be perfectly centred.  \
\
he calls @supports a feature query.  The way he defines this, is that anything dependent on the grid is in the feature query, and anything general is not.  fixed the order of the all file, so my overite comes after the placeholder.  Again, you might have to fuck about with the order of your sass files so that the overight or the last entry that you want does in face come last.  \
\
Ok he focus on fallbacks.  I am going to see if we need fallbacks now, because this is getting really annoying!!!!\
\
No i don\'92t think we need fallbacks now, only if you audience specifically used older browsers, think what stephan said.    \
\
Yes i will check this again.  Just looking at this quick video of image placeholders.  I will check this now.  \

unsplash is powered by picsum, it might be better to use their url for placeholders\

https://picsum.photos/\
\
that is the url:\

you can also specify the image you want like this\

https://picsum.photos/300/300/?image=1003  let me check this works.  \

\
oh yeah to get that html so the rems go up in ten pixels instead of 16, this is a good technique to do or trick\
\
html\{\
\
font-size: 62.5%\
\
remember inline elements have no margin top or bottom, the same for padding, they just go horizontally.  Inline is horizontally.  \
\
we might be able to do this last letter thing.  , no you just text-indent the same amount as your letter spacing - perfect.\
\
it was dev ed\'92s css tricks - remember that css tricks, javascript tricks and see what we can come up with.  \
\
i got a good wee trick here. \
\
Stop trying to carer about doing mistakes, get right in there and fuck about.  \
\
pixel measurement is not relative - 16px is 16px, no matter where it is.\
\
rem and em are relative measurements.  \
\
rem is relative the root element (html element) and em is relative to the parent element\
\
fuck i might just do rem unit measurements, at least i can be really precise then!!\
\
one good reason to use rem is that the user can actually control the height of their text, whereas if you use px they can\'92t.\
\
so it is great for accessibility needs.  \
\
I think it is best to do rem for font-sizes and then do em for padding and margins because that way of you change the font-size the em measurement will also leave a gap of the parent font size, however i don\'92t think that really matters, it is how it is viewed on screen.\
\
You want to control it, but you will never get maximum control.  \
\
ok this could be a good video here, kevin is going to clear this up, ems vs rems.  he said do not use ems for foo-sizes, i am inclined to agree with this, especially like with the unordered lists you give a font size in ems and then again in the li you give a font size in the ems it seems to cascade in to one another.    \
\
Wow the boy was right in travesty media comments, the ems are weird when it comes to margin and padding.  For font-size they get their font-size from their parent, but for margins and padding it takes it measurments from the font-size within the element, so again this seems easier to control.  \
\
cool.  \
\
TL-DR - rem for fonts, em for margin and padding, unless you need a fixed margin then use rems.  \
\
Just tried it, this is the case ems follow the margin and padding size of the element it is in, if there is no size in the element, it will take the measurements from the parent.  \
\
to take away the grid for testing purposes, cancel out the support brackets display grid.  Perfect.  \
\
ok so the rem for the min widths is still 16px for the browser even if you change the font-size in the body, probably stick to pixels for the breakpoints.  I will just check that.  Ah there might be a zooming problem gif you do it with pixels. Here is a counter argument to this:\

Just Use Pixels\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl500\sa480\partightenfactor0

\f12\b0\fs126 \cf40 Pixels are the only unit that behave consistently across all commonly used browsers.\

\f27\i "But what if the user has changed their browser's default font size?"
\f12\i0 \

\f11\b The short answer is set an explicit root font size in pixels.
\f12\b0 \'a0It will override the user's custom default font size which is mildly annoying for the user, but it will force them to zoom instead which always behaves the way you want.\

\f0\fs378 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \
The takeaway here is the user more likely to zoom for accessibility needs or change the font size in settings?  I would go with zoom, although you would never know.  Safari seems like a cunt of a browser.  \
\
Make a decision and stick with it. I would be inclined to make the pixel size fixed and compel the user to zoom.     \

Back from squats, the hormone tried to come in, which masked some pain.  Maybe i don\'92t need to stand wickedly uproght?  two things to try, less upright and break at knees and hips together.  Also try the looking up like i use to do, it might look ugly but maybe takes my pain away.  \
\
hold the kettlebell goblet squat upside down  \
\
the computed section in  the chrome dev tools is extremely helpful.  \
\
the stretching of the back is not perfect with keto when doing weights, it takes out a little focus at the beginning, but it does come back.  \
\
the pseudo elements are display inline as default.  \
\
the clearfix ::after has to be put in the parent element that contains the content and we use  clear: both to stop the floats, but then we have to do display block so it creates a new line break and we have no content, so no content shows up and then we can continue with the next section as it goes back to the default box model layout.  \
\
Yep extends could be bollocks because it doesn\'92t let you use them in media queries, got to do mixins for that.  \
\
wow, that was incredible to get the balance on the mid foot, put a plate in the middle.\
\
Mixins it seems is so much better, it keeps the order of the css perfect too in the css file.  No matter where you call the mixin from it only displays in the css when you use it., not like at the top of the page like an extend if you don\'92t have it in the right order.  \
\
And it gets all called together in the same block of code, not like the extend, when the extend gets called and then another block of code with the same class name with the appended details.  \
\
remember you can write mixins with the pseudo elements too like this:\
\
=clearfix\
	&::after\
		content: ''\
		display: block\
		clear: both\
\
and remember if you want the mixin to be the same all the time, we do not need parameters or arguments.  \
\
and these work inside a media query.  It seems mixins are fucking phenomenal!!\
\
Yeah partials is moving down the markup and styling the sections as you go.  \
\
he is all about equal spacing so if the above has a margin bottom and top of 5em, he will do the padding in the next section the same.  Kevin always has his eye on equality of margins between sections.  \
\
ah i see how he chose the grid there, rather than the float, with the grid, the empty space i was talking about is not there, it is filled in with the portfolio name, whereas float, it goes underneath.  \
\
remember when you do the grid, you don\'92t always needs to span the image right across the columns, it is just for a guide in the layout.  \
\
Now it seems we are doing a gird portfolio, with a flex box fall back.  \
\
the position relative in the figures was so we can position the fig caption inside of it, or in top of it more accurately with position absolute.   \
\
ok remember that, flexbox can be awesome too.  \
\
if you want a heading at the top and the rest of the text at the bottom of the container you do display flex on the parent, and flex-direction: column.\
\
then in the first child (the heading you want to remain at the top) you do simply margin bottom auto and that will keep the heading at the justify start and put the rest of the text in a justify end position.  \
\
do not know why this works but it does.\
\
\
\
The advantage of BEM is does flatten the css and you do not need to nest it then. \
\
so when the flex direction is colun in the parent the default of the children is to stretch to the end of the container, to stop this in the children just to\
\
align-self: flex-start \
\
wow, great stuff.  \
\
to get the arrow on the same line as the figcaption link he did display inline block on the pseudo code rather than block (which would go to the next line).\
\
Ok so the design we have got now is for the hover effect and the focus on mobile.  \
\
so we take this away and then bring it back during hover and focus.  \
\
make the top instead of 0, make it a 100%, that will take it away and then when it is hover bring that back to 0.  \
\
See if i can do this myself. There will be a text transition as well.  \
\
Kevin does the transition in the parent and not the hover element - it does seem to respond marginally quicker, or maybe not, but from my eye it seems so. \
\
ah so he put in a div for the grid, called, portfolio items.  \
\
Ok for the grid, grid-template columns sets the columns order.  Say we put the grid template to two columns and we want one item to stretch the two columns but the other to remain the same, we select that class we want to change and we say:\
\
grid columns: span 2.  \
\
ok these two rules below:\
\
grid-column: 1 / span 2\
		grid-row: 1 / span 2\
\
mean that you are telling the grid that the featured class item has to start at the first column and the first row and spans or stretches the rows and columns.  \
\
instead of writing:\
\
featured. portfolio-desc\{\
\
display: block;\
\
\}\
\
we can do with sass\
\
.feateured & \
	display: block\
\
to do the same thing cool.  ah the overflow hidden helps when the screen gets smaller.  \
\
he changed the padding from 2em to 1em   remember designing for mobile first. \
\
it is flex-wrap for wrap.  Flex wrap means if you run out of room go on one on top of each other rather than on one next to each other.  \
\
Again with the fallbacks, Kevin said as long as it looks passible then move on, do not spend an inordinate amount of time getting it right.  \
\
Kevin says the grid areas are his favourite thing, and he is going to be using that with forms.  \
\
he noticed his mistake with not putting box-sizing: border-box in.  \
\
margin-left: auto will move your element to the far right without using a float.  cool.\
\
Remember the power of auto!!!\
\
ah the reason the auto works is that with auto is trying to take the available space, the reason margin left and right auto centres the element exactly as that they are both taking up the existing space from both sides, therefore making the element perfectly centre.  \

\f0\fs284 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 A little confused here, width auto should be used for every element except images, if you image is short, and you need it to span the whole div then do width 100%.  \
\
auto will take the avlible space, so if you move the element to the far right with margin-left auto, then the width: auto will fill out the available space on the far right.  \
\
maybe flex neck back on the bar to give you that inch away from the knees.  Yeah it seems to have some mileage, although i am finding it harder to cue knees out under this method, however it does seem to allow me to sink right down and I could feel immediately being stronger in that position.  Things to remember is hip drag back until you feel you can\'92t do it no more, knees out and sink down slowly.  You should feel stronger, there will be a little knee compression, but i think they will get stronger through time.  Once i get used to the movement, maybe try it with a neutral head position because it seems the neck creates an posterior tilt which helps to keep my test up.  Try and squeeze the lats if i can, i am getting a a muscle not developed to hold the weight.    \
\
a tip there for the responsive view, come out of the developer tools and back in, it seems to centre it again.  \
\
to seperate the flex box system like the grid, we can do justify content: space around.  \
\
also fuck about with the padding and the margins.  \
\
the best answer i have found so far is when spanning the background  image  across the whole page and making it responsive when the screen gets lower you can use  a media query and expand the width of the background image over 100 per cent say like 120 per cent this keeps the background spanning  the whole page in case it loses its aspect ratio as it collapses.   \
\
it might be fine, this might be a bug.  It is a bug, when you shrink the screen in responsiveness if you have elements that span outside the container like when the screen size gets too small it will show those elements, given the impression that your background image no longer covers the screen container.  That is not the case, it is the fact that, continuing writing this tomorrow.  \
\
check the computed elements, it will tell your their width, so that you can use media queries to bring them in line to the container page space.  Their default width will invaribaly be outside the continuer of the screen size, i.e of responsiveness is 200px, and you see an element to the outside of this you can bet its width is more than 200pxs yeah, it was the tool, not my code!  Yeah the button was about 224 px or something like that, that is how you saw it outside the page.  \
\
Ok after all that I do think it is a glitch because the computed section in google dev tools will tell you if the section is spanning the whole of the page.  \

yeah i love this mixin from kevin:\
\
=mq($width: 50em)\
	@media (min-width: $width)\
		@content\
\
\
i don\'92t know if i like the vw measurement with the font sizes, it takes away the zoom function away from the user.  So much too this.  \
\
Yeah, i think i will take his advice where the page gets bigger and the font gets larger then change it, or maybe not.\
\
Naw, don\'92t like that one.    \
\
remember 12:10 in the video.\
\
 fuck about with grid until you get it right.  All about columns and rows baby!\
\
Just back from the gym.  Again it was close to going wrong.  It seems i need to go splay feet to keep out of the inside of the right knee.  Things to try are gently moving the knees out, maybe not too hard, and then when i feel more confident after the hip shift knees out hard.\
\
If that fails then break hips and knees at the same time and see how that goes.  In the better news the compression on the left leg seems to be getting better.  I was tired in that session and i never quite felt i was sinking into the squat.\
\
My little back was a bit sore, maybe that had something to do with it because of that stupid foot arch\
\
or wider feet, but not pointed out very much and gently open legs.\
\
or the hip break has to be dragged all the way back then knees out.  \
\
I think the best mileage we are going to get is duck feet with a long hip shift then gentle knees out.  \
\
yeah hip shift all the way back. \
\
kevin just showed the auto fir feature with grid - i don\'92t like in his demonstration, but he did say with multiple items it can work really well and you don\'92t really need media queries for it.  \
\
It seems the grid template coloumns repeat functions is just to cut down on the typing we need to do.\
\
For example instead of doing\
\
grid-template-columns : 1 fr 1 fr 1 fr 1f\
\
for 4 columns we could do this:\
\
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr) for the same thing\
\
so it cuts own on writing.  \
\
This is why Kevin prefers the grid to flex, is that we can go from 2 columns to 4 columns with one line of code.  \
\
wow indeed.  \
\
the grid template area with css has quotes in all different rows in the syntax, but with sass it has to be done with quotes in the same line like this:\
\
grid-template-areas: "name  email" "message message" "  .   button"\
\
next time is for the pop up stuff in the portfolio.  cool.  \
\
so with the grid with the template you can give the rows specifically names.  so you do:\
\
grid-template-areas: \'93name1 name2\'94 (this is one row)\
\
\'93message message\'94  ( this is another, but with a difference, the message is the same name twice, so it means the message spans two columns, i think)\
\
\
now you gove these all classes in the markup with the same grid name value.  Then we can tell the gird template area what these areas area bu highlighting the class with the following:\
\
.name\
			grid-area: name\
\
and so on.  \
\
ok so we are going to be making a slide out navigation.\
\
except tis time the hamburger is a svg file.  Will see probably later the utility in doing this.  \
\
i don\'92t think space-evenly is widely supported yet.  Keep checking.  \
\
flex basis initialises the length of a flex item, but i think the father has to be display flex.  \
\
copied kevin\'92s solution from the other tutorial, however, i do not know why it works.  \
\
cool we are on to the javascript. \
\
kevin said we don\'92t need to use semi colns for javascript.  I think this may be an es6 change, i will just check, no it seems it has always been the case.  I will just keep doing the semi colons at I find it easier to read and it lets me know the line is finished.    \
\
Right i saw the problem, for fuck sake.  To be fair the console log was helping me by showing my google class had two full stops before it rather than one.    \
\
right when we use query selector, it works like jQuery in that you can select a class or a tag element.  It also seems to work like the document get element by id in that it is one tag or class that is it looking for, not multiple classes.  A point to add, is when using the query selector if it is a class to access you have to access it the way css would with the full stop before the class name.\
\
\
  The rest of the things like document.getElementsByClassName or\
\
document.getElementByTag are looking through the whole document with the multiple class or tag names which invariable means you have to do some sort of loop. \
\
However, when you want to toggle or add the class via Javascript you have to use classList.toggle or add (with the class name but not like the query selector method)  - you just put in the class name without the period, the browser will add in the full stop for you before the class name.  \
\
Good to know, but not obvious to work out.  \
\
Ok so my back is giving me jip.  I managed to get out of my knees, but it seems no one squats the way i want to.  I will try it again with a level head instead of neck lift, it that doesn\'92t work then it is back to the drawing board.  \
\
maybe the hip break with the knees at the same time, the bar works as a counter keeping you from losing your balance.  Something to  think about.  \
\
this might be futile though, fingers crossed my back gets stronger with rest.  Floowing ripple toe\'92s adivice even though it mat seem counter intuitive, it might get stronger.  \
\
Adapted is the word i was looking for, maybe i am not adapted? I don\'92t think that is right, back still in pain.   \
\
the neutral head maybe be the difference?\
\
the cue that might resonate with me is butt back knees out at the same time.  \
\
Got to be wary of the left kneee getting caught at the breaking point, big hip hinge might help.  This is he last shot, if tis doesn\'92t work, then goblet squats from now on.  I am now 40, time to move on, I am not a young man anymore.    \
\
I liked kevin\'92s definition transition helps elements to transition from one state to another.  \
\
javascript only accepts milliseconds not seconds if it was to code transition on the fly.  \
\
Is that why Kevin includes the transition in the main tag rather than the class toggle tag?  the default of the transition is all properties unless you specifically change this.  \
\
Ok he said to avoid using all because the cpu is doing the animations and it can really slow things down.  Ok.  He said it might be working great on your high end computer, but think of a budget smart phone, maybe not so good.  \
\
There is a way around this to help the cpu is if you are going to be doing multiple transitions on  multiple properties, then you can comma the properties you want to target.  \
\
if you do two numbers in the transition shorthand, the second one is the transition delay property.  \
\
the short hand doesn\'92t seem to follow a specific order.  Since i do not have a delay my time is just the duration of the animation.  \
\
you can do commas on the transition shorthand to do another transition.  \
\
for example:\
\
transition : 1s background ease-in, 500ms transform ease-out 1s\
\
which i think is:\
\
transition-duration: 1000ms\
transition- property: background\
transition-timing-function: ease-in\
transition delay: none;\
\
the second one is:\
\
transition-duration: 500ms\
transition- property: transform\
transition-timing-function: ease-out\
transition delay: 1000ms;\
\
Ok a word on performance apparently transitions can use the cpu or the graphics card, the gpu is better, the cpu will effect loading the page.  \
\
I think Kevin is going to say that transforms and opacities are better because our browsers uses the  graphics card for those animations. than the other properties, which uses the cpu, so it helps them run smoothly.  \
\
Ok there is an error with portion fixed with google chrome, which i will check on the forums later.  Position fixed works with firefox, but not with chrome.  \
\
that wasted a lot of time.\
\
Kevin decided to change the position from fixed to absolute to get it to work across all browsers. \
\
Yes that certainly is a solution, there are a few others getting mentioned, changing position to sticky and manipulating the parent tag.  \
\
There may be some milage in them however a simple solution that lets you keep using the position fixed in chrome may be found in the meta tag.\
\
The secret is i think; \'93minimus scale=1.0\'94  which i will just check.  I don\'92t know why this worked, i think it prevented the page from zooming when using the responsive layout when using position fixed in chrome.  \

\fs284 \cf0 Below is the meta tag to use all the time now:\
\
 <meta name="viewport" content="height=device-height, \
                      width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, \
                      minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0">\
\
the height-device height might not be needed as the device width implies the height.  However, the general consensus is that it is better to have it in than not.  \
\
cool.  I am just going to check if this still works in firefox, i am sure it will. \
\
Yep still works, cool I can carry on now. \
\
A point to remember when moving the site via javascript to the right with the drop down menu it will create a scroll at the bottom, because now the site is overflowing.  \
\
So to rid of that we do, overflow-X: hidden;\
\
ah ok, we can\'92t do an animate of display none just opacity.\
\
\
\
lets try this with opacity.  Yes i do see a wee move.  \
\
yeah the not is pretty good it means in this context to use every li in the list except the last one\
\
so\
\
&:not(:last-of-type)\
\
The solution kevin is working on is if we have to change the position absolute rather than fixed then he wants to limit the scrolling to the menu stays in view.  Keep that at the back of your mind if you need to change to absolute limit the scroll down on the y axis.  \
\
For useribility purposes the position absolute is best.  You don\'92t want that x going away otherwise less technical people will be aware of how to get the menu back.\
\
*remember code for users like Claire* - you will lose views if you don\'92t.  \
\
It must be intuitive, not put in cause you think it is cool.  \
\
Next video is a modals exciting.  i will check what that is.  \
\
yeah that looks great, i will be excited to learn that.  \
\
He said he is going to build his modals inside the portfolio section, kevin thinks it leads to better javascript.  \
\
He said he is going to show us a neat trick that images can span further than the container they are in.  \
\
yeah when we get to the stage of lots of divs stacking up, Kevin likes to comment  on which one of these closes at a particular time, to alleviate the mess.  \
\
Kevin did position fixed and the modal mark up went away, does it have less z-index priority?\
\
put overflow-y: scroll - this is the vertical axis.  You do this when you can\'92t read all the content.  \
\
This confusingly creates two scrolls, but Kevin said this will be changed later on.  \
\
It might be rendering slightly differently on the page that his, because he might be using firefox.  \
\
put in a box shadow at the corners so the content underneath can\'92t be read.  \
\
The box-shadow short hand is\
\
box shadow offset-Y\
\
box shadow offset-x\
box shadow blur\
spread\
\
remember you can have a class name to act differently from the other classes, if you nest it with another.  So that means it inherits the other stuff from the previous classes but the slight change you give it here.  I will just check that.  \
\
Yes it does cool.  So if it has color white from the last class descriptor, it will carry that over cool. \
\
I think i am seeing the :nth-of-type(1)\
\
it means he plans to use the header class for all the modals but this is the first type, the next one will be the:\
\
nth-of-type(2) and so on.  \
\
if you make the father of the pseudo element display: inline block, it means that when you use the pseudo element with 100% width will span the same as the parent before it even with display block.  I will just check this.  Still not really the wiser just that when doing a background colour it doesn\'92t span the whole page.  I will just do some research.  Couldn\'92t really find an answer with my cursory research, but remember it anyway.  \
\
I wonder if i will remember this?\
\
Ok i think i understand the object fit with images.  \
\
One of the problems with using images is that depending on the screen size or the size of the image the image can get squeezed at it loses its aspect ratio and can look really amateurish.  \
\
now the object fit property is great because the browser will go into, \'91maintaining the aspect ratio\'92 mode and if that means cutting the image off slightly then so be it, as long as it looks the part.  \
\
wow the key word initial could be quite strong, it means to go back to the default setting of an element.  \
\
so say to made an inline element display block, you can to display: initial on a particular class with an inline element for it to go back to its default setting of display inline.  \
\
cool.  \
\
ok sometimes nesting can cause an issue with regards to overriding the values.\
\
In y code  here the img tag is nested in all portfolio items, so it means for all portfolio items the image must be 100 per cent width.\
\
because it is not a class it is difficult to override these values because all images underrate the portfolio items are getting this  width  attribute.\
\
the way around this i think is to make these images their own classes, then you will not need to make other images underneath the portfolio items with things like !important to override them.  \
\
ok cool, this is the advantage of BEM.  \
\
different browsers style the buttons differently.  \
\
when using corner buttons, to get out of the modal use position fixed or any position for that matter.  \

\fs284 \cf0 I managed to get the modal to open up and close when i click it, however i do feel my code can be refactored, less see how i do this.  \
\
Ok Kevin doesn\'92t really refactor it, but what he does do, is make another js file, letting you know it is for another event.  \
\
it seems the query selector, doesn\'92t necessitate a loop even for multiple classes, that could be interesting.
\fs374 \
\

\fs284 Ok I have seen first tip, instead of using kevin\'92s method of using anonoumus functions callback, used named callbacks, it makes the code more readable, because you have have all he even listeners and the event callback at the bottom.  Yeah I thought that too, but named functions are only useful if you are referring to them more than once, which for events you don\'92t seem to be.    \
\
This event.target has popped up many times.  I think this is going to be really useful.  \
\
Ok one method that has popped up instead of calling the event on the element itself, use the elements parent. \
\
A common parent seems to be the trick here.  \
\
He said code it all about tradeoffs, using high level logic for a app that doesn\'92t need much code manipualttion seems to be over kill, whereas using simple procedural code for a big application is not smart either.  \
\
I need to learn about the event target.  \
\
Just getting an overview of code refactoring, this guy says he makes smaller functions so he can, \'91pipe them together\'92  which is called pipe style programming.\
\
guard programming concept, this is suppose to be for advanced writing of code in that,\
\
if it is the equal to this, return STOP!!!\
\
if it is equal to this return STOP!!\
\
else run code.  \
\
Andy gives great tips here - do not abbreviate variables unless they are widely recognised like url http etc.  \
\
instead descriptively name our variables.  \
\
function arguments, do not have longer than 3 function arguments.  \
\
I knew this, so if you have more than three arguments make it an object and pass in the object as the argument.  \
\
making functions make sure it does just one thing, the other function should just do the one thing too.  \
\
functions should be short. \
\
Avoid using zombie code which means code that you commented out that may be returned to later.  \
\
It as andy says it increases the noise ratio when reading as you will be distracted.   If you do have zombie code, put it in your git ut not in the production part.  \
\
ok here we are going to be learning about this little, \'91e\'92 that is passed as a paramater in functions.  \
\
the e is the event object.\
\
\
Remember whenever we see a good hip break or hinge in a squat, (female or a powerlifting squat) while you may fancy doing it, No erections!!! doh!!!   
\fs374 \

\fs284 \
A good place to start is the syntax of the event listener  function.  \
\
i am learning about the events here in javascript, \'91capturing, target and bubbling\'92\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f30\fs118 \cf36 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Let\'92s start with event propagation. This is the blanket term for both event bubbling and event capturing. Consider the typical markup to build a list of linked images, for a thumbnails gallery for example:
\f0\fs284 \cf0 \cb1 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \
\pard\tx566\tx1133\tx1700\tx2267\tx2834\tx3401\tx3968\tx4535\tx5102\tx5669\tx6236\tx6803\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0  \
Just going off in a thought pattern here. I thought we would need to wrap li items and images in a link, but i don\'92t think you need to do that now with display flex.\
\
you can make anchors display flex even if it comes after the two previous elements and it will span the whole of the parent.  I am just going to check that.  \
\
It appears the bbc doesn\'92t wrap anchors in images, it uses javascript for the click event, i think it uses the father div to make a pointer and then uses javascript to go through the link.  in fact i am going to just switch the javascript off to test this.   \
\
the inline still has padding bottom but no padding top.  \
\
Ok back from the first session of goblet squats, got a little hormone release so that seems ok.  I managed to do 32 kilos, is this going to keep going up?  \
\
left knee, feels a bit weary on the turn, this might be due to train knees forward at the beginning.  No I think tis is going to be a consequence of heavy goblets and deadlifts.  Get the knee wrap on after it to keep the inflammation down as possible.  I don\'92t think the knee will go, as the weights will never get heavy enough for that to happen, however i expect it to be perninaennally uncomfortable.  I am getting older, there is always going to be a consequence of weight training.  That was fucking terrible btw.  My abductirs cannot go right down and my ankles severely lack mobility to do it.  So i am glad i have tried everything.  On to my next phase of life now.  What i expect now is that my build will get narrower, i will get leaner and i will not be as strong.   Yeah that seems to be happening, never slept well, I hope this passes too. Slept a little better, and when i took the morning shit i felt better too.  Still feel weird.  The build does seem to be setting into a narrower frame.    \
\
However, this might give me advantages with frequency and focusing on other muscle balancing exercises.  Not it doesn\'92t lol.    \
\
Ok cool, lets see where i can go from here.    \
\
That was good, i thought the bbc was using javascript to make the whole container clickable, but no instead of wrapping the content in an anchor tag, you use a pseudo element from the a tag and a z index, to make the whole container clickable.  interesting. \
\
So it seems to make containers clickable we have four options as far as i can see.  We can wrap the container in an anchor tag.  If we don\'92t want to do that for the markup we can use display flex to span the whole container but the parent has to be display flex too.  Or we can use the pseudo code before the anchor element and a position relative from the parent and a position absolute for the pseudo element and get it to cover the parent element with a z-index to make to clickable.  You actually do not need to display block here which is weird.  \
\
Lastly we can use javascript to make the container clickable.  \
\
i think having display: block in doesn\'92t make too much of a difference.\
\
event.phase property is in the event listener object.  \
\
I like this boy\'92s motto on his website, \'91close enough is good enough\'92\

\ul \ulc4 kirupa}} says the event handler is in the event listener?  \
\
That is right, it is all about lines of code, that is why we try and refactor, every line of code is a node in the chain and that node takes up memory, so if we can refactor code to be more efficient we win both ways, less code to work through and less memory used.  Getting it to work is just the first step.  Test driven development.   \
\
Ok this idea of one event listener and one event handler.  \
\
The thing about loops is what element do you choose it to loop through?  If the elements are contained in a div container, then surely it makes sense to loop through that right?  \
\
concentrate not on muscle but on smarts!!\
\
ok this idea of propagation or bubbling is that when an event is called, the window object goes all the way down the dom tree to find the element that has the event attached to it then fgoes all the way back up.  The other guy explained this as capturing, targeting, bubbling.\
\
He says that is inefficient.  However to stop that we can use the event to attache the event to the parent tag and  the bubble down but stop it from bubbling back up once it has found the event, therefore fire the event when it has found the parent tag i think.  I think it is called event.stopPropagation().  \
\
we can use a loop for the many modules because we have more than one module or we can try kirpu\'92s technique with the parent for the modules.  \
\
i am now beginning to think of this logically.  \
\
he did say that if you have a more complex layout, then try and find a common parent where you can do this from.  The obvious one that springs to mind is the body element.  \
\
This guy explains event propagation into three phases, the capture phase (this is where the window object is trying to capture your event element), the target phase (it has located where the element where the event is to take place) and the bubbling phase( it goes back up to the window object to execute the event.\
\
I am seeing the architecture of the dom tree in action here.  When an element has been clicked on by the user the dom tree begins to work itself down telling each element below that something has been clicked below it.  \
\
you can use document.getElementsByClassName with a loop and it will loop through all those with that class name.  \
\
the addEventListener third parameter should be false, because we are telling the event to complete after the dom has returned back to the top, the bubbling phase. \
\
True would be the capturing phase. Actually either or could be fine.   \
\
That is a great idea if we make a video, is to wrap it up with a summary.  Seems more professional that way.  \
\
the event.stopPropagation() depends on if you set the previous eventListener to the capture phase (true) or the bubbling phase (false).\
\
If you set it to the capture phase the event.stopPropagation() would only let the parents know about the click event but not the target element.  If it was set to the bubbling phase then the target element would only be notified but not the parents.  \
\
I have got side tracked a little here, i am looking at local storage in javascript since my dissertation used it to do the automatic refresh of the page.  \
\
Locally storage allows the browser to save data from a user even if the user refreshes the page.  \
\
local storage can hold up to 2 - 100 mb of data held in a json format.  Useful of user web interface data (where they click, how they navigate the page).\
\
As in typical javascript we have a local storage object, which has:\
\
localStorage\{\
\
 setItem = function ()\
	getItem = function ()\
removeItems = function ()\
\
which transfers into this:\
\
localstare.setitems()\
localStorage.getitems()\
\
\
\
the coder manipulates the local storage by setting up the code before the user visits the site.  \
\
Try the cani with the big D tomorrow.  Switch off at end of day.  Ok back to the 30 min then rest, reward, repeat. \
\
I do like how big and fat it is, wow.  Someone called it a monster lol.\
\
The local storage, and cookies and sessions are all ways that the browser can store user data.  Local storage seems to be the biggest storage facility on the browser.  \
\
local storage seems to never expire, session storage expires after the browser is closed, which funnily enough ends the session.  \
\
Ok here I am getting a deeper understanding of cookies and sessions.  \
\
say you log into your bank account.  It asks for username and password - it will check its datadase to see if that corresponds with what you have inputed in.   Then some bank applications will send your details to the browser to keep for this session like, the username and password.  It is unreadable by any other browser, but it is data unique to you.  It severs when you end the session.  \
\
I think when google asks to keep your password for this site it keeps it in local storage or is that the cache?\
\
it is like what i thought.  This boys says it can be used to remember your log in data.  it is used by website owners to track how their users use their web page, all users have a unique cookie id.  \
\
i didn\'92t know this by say you go on amazon and are looking for halloween costumes then later on that day you may find advertisement in face book for more halloween costumes, he said that is done by the cookies.  Interesting.   Specifically, third party cookies.   \
\
So yeah the amazon example he gave, was a third party cookie.  In that say there was a facebook button in your site, Facebook will use their cookie to take the information for that site to send you targeted ads later.  \
\
coupon codes can also be a cookie.  However with the exception of third party cookies, a cookie is only relevant  the the website you are using.  \
\
I saw some of the cookies under the chrome tab.  and you can get the make up of the cookie on your hard drive. \
\
Ok this is enough, back to refactoring. \
\
I still need to know about this event object.\
\
The, \'91e\'92 in the event listener is to help to target the siblings, the parents in the dom.  \
\
It might be a good idea to learn the properties of the event object.  \
\
first i know is;\
\
the e.target - which tells you what element you clicked on if it was a clicked event.  Current target seems to be a good one. I still don\'92t really know the difference.  \
\
I think i kind of get it.  Current target is what the event is tied to.  Target is what actually happens.  The target will always be the target.  For example, two boxes, one inner box and one outer box.  No moving in the seat, cfs.  The outer box is the current target, the inner and outer box is both the target with the click.  Target is better and i think it has wider scope.    \
\
e.type tells you what type of event it was, a click a keypress etc, it may event tell you what key the user pressed to do it.  \
\
the key word in the event listener function is to, \'91listen\'92 for these events, if you make it a click event, the browser will be listening for when you click the mouse.  \
\
That is clever, i don\'92t know how i missed this, when i was learning javascript but this query selector thing is just like the jquery shorthand.  It almost/does allow you to select elements very much like the css would do.  In that if you want to select the first child of a div that is an h2 element you don\'92t need to do something like this;\
\
const parent = document.getElementById(\'93parent\'94).\
\
const parentChild = parent.firstChild.innerText.\
\
by rather you can do this:\
\
const parentsChild = document.querySelector(\'93#parent p\'94)\
\
that actually gets to the parent\'92s child, amazing.  \
\
\'93yes calm down and develop the brain!\'94 \'93 you could be good at this!\'94  \'93talent usurps looks in this world\'94\
\
\'93help people through your skill\'94.  \
\
\'93oh aye, do not rush the writing of the code, we want to mitigate the comments in the code by making the code itself as readable as possible\'94  \'93take time to write the code and admire the beauty in it, much the same way as a writer would with every line of sentence\'94.  I don\'92t know if that is true, surely it is it TDD pricinples that are best.  Get it to work then refactor.  Code as chunks.  Unit testing.  So say you have a big in task.  Code to get that to work, then when you have, refactor as you go.  \
\
\'93also maybe there is some utility of focusing on the new knowledge as being the value rather than i have to do this to get a job and do this etc\'94.  naw, the knowledge, will build you up to be a millionaire.  \
\
The net ninja here is talking about how to manipulate the event object\'92s properties.  \
\
for example if you want to respond to something when someone presses the shift key you can do something like this:\
\
if e.shiftKey === true\{\
do something\
\
else \{\
\
do do something\
\
\}\
\
the e.preventDefault() is as the name suggests, to prevent the default behaviour of a particular element.  In this example it the anchors default behaviour would be the click through to the link it has.\
\
preventing this default behaviour would be encloesed in this method:\
\
e.preventDefault()\
\
Ok that will do, i do not think i am going to learn all the various ways of doing coding these, i have got to do it but doing, rather than tutorial hell.  \
\
Lets look at refacoring my code. \
\
ok I am going to taks myself with shorting the code with using less event listeners by manipulating a common parent.  \
\
That was quite a good video about confidence, don\'92t try to be confident, it is normal to feel weird.  \
\
Kevin\'92s idea is really simple and perhaps like all simple ideas is one of the best.  Like his sass, he compartmentalise\'92s the files according to tasks or sections.  \
\
First he has the nav toogle task so he puts that in a separate js file.  \
\
then he has a modal appearance task and has that in another js file.  \
\
It is not refactoring, but it does make it easier to read.  \
\
Ok i am going to try and get the same functionality with the idea of event delegation.  \
\
this is twice i have seen this method now:\
\
rather than doing a for loop, boys seems to be doing this instead:\
\
const children = Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName(\'91child\'92);\
\
the boy said the above code doesn\'92t return an actual array but an array like object called an HTML collection that we can loop through.  \
\
children.forEach( child => \{\
\
child.addEventListener(\'91click\'92, () => console.log(child.innerHTML));\
\});\
   \
\
Ok the boy made some good arguments on when to use event delegation and when to not use it.  \
\
He stressed the point of using it when the childs that you want the event to take place have the same parent, then it makes real sense to use event delegation.\
\
Stef\'92s advice about not trying to do everything is sound, and he said he found a hard time letting go of the coding part.  He did say, find out what you suck at and get that person to do it.  \
\
However, the tech lead, still seems to bang out the code for his ideas.  He must pay for someone to look after them, he must.    \
\
However, when the code is very complex and finding the common parent is difficult then he said you may get a performance hit because of event propagation bubbling and capturing up and down the dom tree.  \
\
However, one of the other dudes said the performance hit is minimal.  \
\
The general consensus, seems to be use it for bigger applications, but don\'92t for smaller javascript applications.  \
\
Right i want to try this to see if i can do it.\
\
Things to try for goblet squats, got knee pain at 32 kgs, try less leg opening, try knee and hip break at same time with really wide open feet.\
\
try bigger hip shift at the beginning, and last but not least, watch the weight lifted.  \

\cf0 \
Ok big findings from this workout.  One it really drains me and makes me look flat when i initially come out.  It takes really long to recover and there is  acute depression from it.  I feel weak and this idea of increasing my volume is not going to go well, because i think i need at least 5 days to recover.  Doing a job, when i need these powers or recovery is not really promising.  \
\
it does eventually come round the next day, after 14 hours in bed.  I will be able to get a better picture after more powerful exercise like good morning and hip thrusts are integrated.  It looks like neck exercises are going to help fix my posture.  Specifically trying the neck to get back.  \
\
Interesting, maybe i have low endorphins levels?  Research this.  \
\
Ok while the build will never be what it was like, it does seem to get better the next day and when coffee is added.  \
\
Don\'92t push to the max energy with reps, in fact stay in the one or two rep range.  Give your body some breathing space.  Think strong, not fit.  View it almost as a posture correcting routine.  \
\
Don\'92t go violent with the exercise, slow and strong!  \
\
There is a potential i might get ripped with this look.  At least that will keep me going.  Yeah that was before the back went.  Since stopping the barbell back squats, my back has got weak.  I think i need to get some sort of variation of spinal loading to keep my back strong. \
\
The depression is alarming, and real.  I might have to get to a stage where i have to choose between the monster and being strong.\
\
Yeah my thinking about the carnivore diet compared to the keto, would the back pain happen on the keto - yes i think it would.  My line of thinking with the back pain is that if you sacrifice one big lift then the other three half to go as well, as you don\'92t have the width or robustness to handle the big weight, or it may  be you don\'92t get the hormone release to protect you.      \
\
Ok here\'92s is a thought.  Get the cock realise from the goblet squat and then the power from quarter squats.  Can you get both?  Game for a try.  The theory sits well with me, but the reality may be entirely different.  It will prob take a couple of workouts to tell.    \
\
Ok my learning of event delegation.  \

Yes, you can do it from one event listener, from a common parent.  However, the code is not intuitive unless you make the if statements answer call back functions, however this will make it easier to read but then eat into the advantage of doing the deleigation in the first place, as you are just swapping many event listeners for callback explaining functions.  \
\
the event target is a gift, you enclose that in its own variable like so;\
\
let target= e.target.\
\
then you can do conditionals off that like\
\
if (target.closest(\'93.menu-button\'94)\{\
\
let body = document.body;\
body.classList.add(\'93nav-is-open\'94);\
\
very good.  I am going to try and shorten this code, see if it still works. \
\
The closest rather than matches seems to work the best because it uses the bubbling and capututring propagation to find out the parent in which the element was clicked, this might just work with the parent - .menu-button.  Let me try this.  \
\
Yes it does.  Ok i am going to listen to a  video of why closest is best - it seems this was taken from the jquery library.  \
\
ev.target - tells me the thing i just clicked on.  \
\
like i found out with the document.querySelector - you can put any css, \'91way\'92 inside of it like \'91body main div p.smith\'92 - to select it cool.  It works like a css selector.  \
\
\
Wow, i think i just found the answer as to why matches wasn\'92t working as opposed to closest and it really something to do with the svg\'92s  - the svg\'92s don\'92t le you really bubble up like the normal elements do.  \
\
I got a little confused here with the paragraphs.  if you stack two paragraphs on top of each other, even with different id\'92s one is  not the parent of the other one, but rather a sibling (a fellow child)\
\
so say you have two paragraphs and you have two different ids for them and by using the event.closest(# by marching the id of the first paragraph) you are expecting also for the second paragraph to do something when clicked, that will not happen. \
\
The reason it will not happen is because with bubbling it will not crawl back up the dom tree through the siblings but rather the parents.  So if you called the first id of the paragraph, \'93frank\'94  but the second one was called, \'93davy\'94 and you expect a click behaviour by doing a closest to frank, noting will happen on the second paragraph, \'91davy\'92.  \
\
What happens is that the second paragraph checks to see if it has an id of Frank and finds that it does not, then it goes up the dom tree through its parents to find Frank (bypassing the sibling paragraph with the name Frank) and discovers it is not there, therefore returns null.  \
\
Null being no object.  \
\
So matches should work when you do not have svg\'92s underneath, but closest is best when it is svgs.  \
\
yeah the svgs are weird.  \
\
here is a source to back up what i just found:\

\fs284 ok I am going back to a similar way to what Kevin was doing.  I am going to compartmentalise the javascript events in two separate files.  \
\
I am looking at coding conventions - one tip here is to indent the code when inside a function as opposed to outside.  \
\
brain is done already.  \
\
goal setting - what do i want?\
\
Lets search crazy things, time travel, aliens, contacting the dead. \
\
recursive function is one that calls itself.  \
\
the other kind is self-invoking functions. This is the one with the brackets before the function name.  \
\
They are sometimes called self-executing functions.  Or immediately invoked functions.  \
\
Iffes as they are calling them, main advantage seems to be when you are going to use the function once and containing everything in a local scope environment away from the globals you ahem defined.  \
\
This boy said we can wrap anything in brackets in javascript.   Can we wrap Objects? \
\
he mentioned the local scope importance again and not for global variables.  \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs106 \cf8 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Function with names are useful only when you need to call them from different places in your code\
\
\

\fs220 This explanation keeps coming up time and time again:\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f35\i\fs156 \cf33 \cb102 Next time whenever you are creating a bunch of variables and functions in global scope that no one uses outside your code, just wrap all of that in an IIFE and get a lot of good JavaScript karma for doing that. Your code will continue to work, but now you are not polluting global scope. Also you are shielding your code from someone who may change your globals accidentally, or sometimes intentionally!\

That is a great tip for coming up with your own app ideas, internet ideas.  Copy first!!\

He gave the example that great artists where first great copiers, to hone their technique, then when they felt the could look at any painting (in the the style they want to create) and do it, then they knew they were profiecent enough to do it theirselve.  \

So like when i was the band manager, the advice was to do covers then their own.  That way they would learn how to craft a song and what it feels like.  \

yes this boy here outlines the problem with svg\'92s the graphic where the svg is works as a click but the white space does not, hence creating this sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\'92t thing.  \

\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl646\partightenfactor0

\f14\fs131 \cf40 \cb3 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
SVG does not have a box layout model. You see, when an SVG document is contained by an HTML document, within a CSS layout, the root SVG element adheres to the box layout model. Its child elements do not. As a result, most CSS layout-related properties don\'92t apply to SVG.\
So instead, SVG has what I\'92ll call a \'91shape model\'92. When we add a link or an event listener to an SVG document or element, the interactive area will not necessarily be a rectangle. SVG elements\'a0

\

\fs290 Ok try this, first do the capturing mode, then do the pointer events off in the css while keeping the bubbling on.  \
\
Cause the brain is thinking of millionaire status now, it seems it is more efficient at not dealing at the bullshit.  \
\
I couldn\'92t find the answer to any it works in the capturing mode and not the bubbling phase, hopefully one day i will.  \
\
Did the immediately invoked function expression with the event listener load.  \
\
the idea it is to make it anonymous and take out the name of the function and wrap it it in brackets there.  \
\
This method of e.stopPropagation works as well it seems to stop the capturing phase and the bubbling phase, leaving the element to do what it was suppose to do.  If you assigned an event listener to it and it doesn\'92t work it could be because of the propagation blocking the behaviour.  You can relate that with e.stopPropagation() method.  \
\
Ok I am going to have to park this, the knowledge doesn\'92t seem to be there online easily.  Close enough is good enough remember.  It seems the svg\'92s bugger up the propagation with the clicks, so we have a few options to fix this.  \
\
they say make pointer-events to none in the css, that didn\'92t work for me.  \
\
make the parent of the svg true on the capturing phase.\
\
or keep all events on the bubbling phase but stop the propagation on the svg element itself and it should work as planned.  \
\
It seems there is no getting away from the privacy element.  However you can use a pseudonym and market it that way, like Whisky Pete.\

Privacy is dead.  \

Right a bit of brainstorming here.  It seems the opportunities to make money are plenty, but plenty in one direction - the internet.  \
\
I don\'92t think the annoymonity idea is going to fly.  It could when you write for a business that sells stuff.   \
\
There are two worlds now, the real and the virtual.  The virtual is fake, full of platitutues, as Ricki Gervias says, \'91comments from people that live in a bin\'92.  \

I think you have to be genuine to make money online but it is exposing.  I am not comfortable exposing myself.  \

\
The business is the model, not the individual.  Ok, so the coding knowledge is what is going to set me free.  I need to get really good at this.  Keep looking at how websites are designed, ideas of course.  But this prostitiution of yourself to strangers, fuck right off,  it is like pyramid selling. \
\
I need to make something.  An app that solves problems.  First I need to get really good at development.  \
\
Remember you do have something to offer, you are a master.  \
\
The way this world is going has good and bad things.  \
\
Just read a blog that clarified it, if you don\'92t have a product to sell, you have nothing, blogs will do nothing at best 25 % of the business model, the guy only made 15 blog posts last year.    \
\
\
Business bit - an overview of a good website that looks to be profitable.  This is going for 850,000 pounds - which signifies that it makes money.  \
\
A great idea to see what websites work is to see what is up for sale, the most expensive ones are the best, supposedly.  This website i saw was called, \'91best\'92 advisor\'92  the jist of the site. It looks like a large affiliate site where there are five lanaguges to choose from and it gives you reviews on the best products\
\
So there is a review section at the top - that takes you to a end page like this:\
\
Just checking the network tab - CDN in the url?\
\
CDN\'92s make it so useful to get a world wide audience.  CDN\'92s idea is to have you site stored over a number of servers all over the world.  If you just had a local market then a normal uk host will be fine because that will come for the hosts uk server and that will reach the uk audience.  However, if you want the USA audience as well then a server based in the uk is not going to cut it, the speed will be slow.  So to get round that a cdn will allow use customers to get your website from a use server allowing them to enjoy as fast as speeds as your uk clients do.

\fs284 \cf0 \
ok, i think they have their own database, how the hell did they get the content?\
\
so as i was saying the review page goes to a table page with the pros and cons of the 5 products then it extrapolates it down below with bigger pictures and more explanation. and then down below it gives an overview of what the products actually are.  \
\
This is all linked to the amazon page where it sells the product that you are talking about.  \
\
The, \'91how to\'92 section works a little differently.  It is more of the information section, with  little in text links to the buy page again.  \
\
it is not as direct this time, but the page does show side links for its best products again with the table page and the link to purchase from amazon.  \
\
It seems there is an amazon api.  \
\
another website, powered by shopify called american greats.  Shofify seems great for e commerce and dropshipiting.  You can do one with scotland and link it to an amazon store on all things scottish.  \
\
While it is in my head, vapes, keto, italian shoes, gold, blockchain, bits, short links, digital products.\
\
This is much better.  \
\
Right back to Kevin.  See what you can do for us Kevin.  \
\
I saw the code problem there with the fact when you click on a nav menu item.  The Toggle isn\'92t enough, to get away the scrolling problem.  The reason why is that the toggle only works when you click the hamburger and close the x, the behaviour for that is to freeze the scrolling of the y overflow.  \
\
however if you were to take the overflow out and let the scrolling happen you would be faced with the original problem which would be the container 80 percent out with the nav menu and over scrolling left on the x axis.  \
\
So what you do is you must do a behaviour style when the nav menu items are clicked.  So you do a click event on the nav items and then when that is clicked you take the .nav-is-open class out of the body, returning the page back to the default behaviour before the hamburger was pressed, this solves the problem.  \
\
I will just do this now.  Yeap sorted it.  So it says on the official w3 validator that you cannot have a div as child to figure, however what the validator has not picked up is that this is displayed on a button request. No, i think the validator is correct, it was Kevin that had it wrong.  You don\'92t need to wrap it into the fig caption.  Wait to the figure is closed because the modal comes after it, not in it.   \
\
It makes sense to put it in the mark up rather than coding this in the javascript to get around the validator.  \
\
the folding of divs is shocking in the sublime editor, I hope that doesn\'92t cause problems however it makes it difficult to see how the parent is.  \
\
You can collapse it easily in google dev tools though, i just tested it by taking out the div out and of course the website collapsed and the div parent changed.  \
that has annoyed me, so it makes it harder to follow the code. \
\
Apparently it is because of the  indents in sublime.\
Kevin actually does mention event propagation in a way by mentioning that it is important to stick to the minimum amount of  event listnerers.  \
\
Ok the penny just dropped with that one there.  I need to use the dom tree to get to the model from the event object, so that the correct modal comes up for each portfolio item.  \
\
cool.  \
\
how did we change the selection of the featured display again the order i mean.\
\
Yeah I still can remember how we did that, maybe not, i think it is ok.   \
\
The error is coming from  the portfolio item featured, because it is a different class from the portfolio item, I thought it was that, but really it was because there was no sibling div.  \
\
Christ I think kevin just answered my question. \
\
\
I done it anyway with my way with the for loop - remember the [i] after the loop.  \
\
remember the [i] variable when writing out the event listener like this;\
\
closeModal[i].addEventListener(\'93click\'94, callback, false);\
\
However kevin is showing us a way with no for loop and less code.\
\
in that we don\'92 t call the document query selector but rather the element we click on query\'92s selector, very clever.  I am going to jus re-read the code to see if I follow it.    \
\
Kevin is just reminding us that you can\'92t put transitions on display block or z-index\'92s . \
\
@keyframes seems to be the thing for animations, however you need to reference a div before it, with the animation property.  \
\
Take a look at wordpress development, it could really speed up your workflow.  \

\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec106 Hmm... I've been working with WordPress for about 5 years and I think you're saying here is bit overly simplified. What you are describing here I've seen referred to as  WordPress Enablers. Mainly designers that don't know a lot of coding that install and configure WordPress themes and plugins to build a site. \
\
There are actual developers that specialize in WordPress that do way more than just installing themes and plugins and create high end custom coded solutions for clients.  There's a misconception that there is no real development in WordPress, but there is. Also, Where do you think all the WordPress themes and plugins come from?\
\
There are high level front-end and backend developers that  work solely with WordPress. It seems like you're dismissing those developer's talent here by using the term WordPress Professional. It makes it sound like anyone who's made a profession working with WordPress can't be real  a developer.

Trying to understand why we don\'92t need to use loop through the document or even the parent element to close the modal.  \
\
the element also has this property too or query selector.  \
\
Still never really got the jist of it there, still do not why we don\'92t need to loop.  Ok i think something just dropped in my mind there.  The reason the button doesn\'92t close when using document.query selector is because it is still in the first modal class, whereas you have clicked either 1 2 or 3.  \
\
doing the modal query selector on the modal itself, lets the browser know you are trying to close the modal you are in.  \
\
you could do a stop propagation here maybe while using the document?  \
\
Ok so maybe i don\'92t understand it, but always think that instead of doing a loop, we can access the parent element, rather than the document.  Still don\'92t understand why i don\'92t have to loop from the parent lol.  \
\
doing an event with escape too.  \
\
key press 27 i think.  \
to truncate the code of the different events but with the same execution you can write a function execution so each event refers to the same execution.  \
\
Remember opacity of 0 makes it look like it dissappeared but it is still there.  \
\
ok I just saw the scoping of variables there, watch for that see if the variable has already been set, other wise you will be doing more code than is necessary.  Remember callbacks are really still in the local scope of the parent function or the global scope because it is a property or a method of the previous decalered variable.\
\
scoping might be more complicated that i think.  Watch out for that.  \
\
Not following this, made a mistake with the scoping, will get there tomorrow.  Ok saw the value of function expressions, expressions make it easier to keep the scope effective when i just made a function declaration from a call back it couldn\'92t find it because the scope had gone, whereas if you put it in a variable it will be displayed.  cool.  \
\
i need to learn more about decelerations and expressions and scope yep i do.  \
\
Try and Give the customer something for free.  \
\
Called the method reciprocity - in that if you give something away for free, the customer feels obligated to buy from us - yep that makes sense.  \
\
For example a well known psychologist did an experiment where he sent out christmas cards to 600 strangers and got 200 replies wow.  People feel compelled to reply in kind.\
\
also try out mattress free for a 100 days, usually means the customer will end up keeping the mattress even if they don\'92t like it, two reasons, the company where good enough to give a free trail and two it is a fucking mattress, the hassle of getting that picked up is annoying.  \
\
a great way to add to your drop store is to offer personalised coupons to your store.  \
\
spin to win pop up boxes on your site .  She says to include a note in the product packaging.  How do you do that if you don\'92t own the stuff?  \
\
she says get them to leave reviews, social proof for potential customers.  That is the obvious psychology going on here but the unobvious one is customer envy, \'91keeping up with the jones\'92  they are so happy with the product, i wan that happiness for myself.  \
\
shoplify with stamp.io which automatically flies an email out theo the customer asking for a review.  she said there is one called jump stead, same thing but for amazon shops.  \
\
create curiosity in your customers, activated an itch that they need to scratch. \
\
our galaxy is the milky way, i didn\'92t know that lol.  \
\
when we know nothing about something we a re not that curious, but when we know a little bit of something about something we become very curious!!!\
\
The more we know beyond that, the less curious we become.  \
\
again the pop up spin the wheel game works for the curiosity as well, because they know the might win something, just not quite sure, so they will give you their email to find out.  Get the email list!!!\
\
good email title - \'93i have a favour i would like to ask you?\'94\
\
photos work, but show photos of it being worked in action, like that umbrella keeping the keys on the wall. \
\
remember also the pleasure and pain principle.  Pain works better, but one if the product itself cures that pain.  Like an avavoda peeler , the pain of the mess going everywhere.  The pleasure would be a product you don\'92t really need but would bring a lot of pleasure, like trading your shitty phone for an iPhone.\
\
Need to research if i can do drop shipping part time.  \
\
Right the scope of event listeners.  \
\
i am using the console.log here to debug.  Unfortunately there is no real indication  what portfolio item class i am in when it comes to using the element selector versus the document.  \
\
although i have just got a null here with the document query selector.  \
\
Ah this is quite complicated to put into words but i will try.  \
\
Ok we did a click event on the parent - .portfolio-items\
\
that gives us access to all the children which is the portfolio item of each.  right so the click even is in all the items this is why each one will open.\
\
so this saves a loop  because if you were to put the event on each portfolio item then it would need a loop otherwise the document would just select the first one.  \
\
So the loops depend on what element you put the event listener on.\
\
now when it comes to closing it this is where it can\'92t get quite confusing. however, the console. log is very clever because it is telling you you are no longer in the correct portfolio item.  \
\
For example, the first console.log of target when you click to open the modal telling you are in the correct portfolio item.  \
\
However when to go to select the close button by accessing the document tree it will be trying the close the module of the first one in the dom tree, because you are using the document without a loop and it will just go through it once and select the first class.  \
\
Maybe i can show this in the console.  Kind of did.  \
However when it is all said and done the console is showing you that you are trying to close the first portfolio item when you are in the 3 or 4th.  This solution is either a loop through the document or acting on the modal that is open under the specific portfolio item by querying the element you are in rather than the body.  cool. \
\
yes watch with the long function names, it makes it harder to spell.  \
\
Yeah, i think after all that it was a spelling error.  \
\
After all that i thought it was down to me and my coding errors and my coding structure.  I thought it was a nesting problem, but no, it was a coding spelling mistake.  \
\
In conclusion, watch for the function and variable names = too long and it leaves the problem for spelling mistakes.  When we see an undefined, check the spelling first and very closely\
\
backToPortfolio compared to\
\
backToPorfolio.  \
\
wow learning about scoping there.\
\
clever there, yeah me, i did something nice with the scope - i am proud of it, took out the nested functions but still connected them through the  event object parameter,  that is the value of parameters, parameters enable you to protect the scope and it allows your code to keep going but having them all contained in their environment.  I am going to put it back into the nesting, so the global to the variable defined comes \
with the parent function.  Good practise, i like that.  \
\
if you don\'92t want to define the variables again in their local environment. have them nested in the parent function and then you will always have access to them.   \
\
remember removeEvenlListener other wise the same event listener will keep happening.  \
\
Kind of got it.  \
\
Investigate how many parameters can go into a event listener callback.  One way to pass parameters into an event is this:\
\
<!DOCTYPE html>\
<html>\
<body>\
\
<p>This example demonstrates how to pass parameter values when using the \
addEventListener() method.</p>\
\
<p>Click anywhere in the document to perform a calculation.</p>\
\
<p id="demo"></p>\
\
<script>\
var p1 = 5;\
var p2 = 7;\
\
document.addEventListener("click", function() \{\
  myFunction(p1, p2);\
\});\
\
function myFunction(a, b) \{\
  var result = a * b;\
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = result;\
\}\
</script>\
\
</body>\
</html>\
\
Ok with kevin here i am going to use the escape event, \'91keypress 27\'92 , however it will have the same execution code so i am going to extract that away into a helper function to prevent dry.  \

Just saw the advantage of named callbacks, you can reuse the same callback for different events. \
\
Ok viewing some websites to get ideas on what website to replicate just by looking at their screen.  Still a lot of them have this fixed screen size width.  \
\
ok virgin atlantic i am going to try and copy.   \
\
Ok so virgin seems like a weird website, apple and abc let me download their html content. \
\
Ok doing british gas, looks to be a challenge. lists of pics and background stuff.  \
\
first the work flow.  \
\
Right just starting this workflow, but that was weird as fuck, when i git cloned the htdocs it made a new directory for me and gt enabled that, but there was no git in the hotdogs weird.  Whereas when i created a new directory called brisitish gas, when i cloned it, it made another directory as a child and didn\'92t take the copied stuff over.   \
\
removing git is done like this, remember the fucking space!! - 
\f7\fs84 \cf3 \cb4 \CocoaLigature0 rm -rf git
\f0\fs284 \cf0 \cb1 \CocoaLigature1 \
\
ghghg, actually it is this one, the fullstops was not there!!! 
\f7\fs84 \cf3 \cb4 \CocoaLigature0 rm -rf .git

\
Ok so I am going to be learning how to use adobe xd, learn the design tool before i begin to make it into html.  \
\
When Kevin picks his colours, he uses a website called, \'91coolers\'92  - you can modify by clicking the unlock icon and then the adjust icon.  \
\
When you lock and then hit space bar again, it will keep the palette you chose and try and match colours alongside it.  \
\
Another website is called, \'91typspiration\'92 to get a few ideas of what fonts go together.  \
\
Yeah p-interest is great for inspirational designs, i saw one there with a mountain top that was absolutely gorgeous.  \
\
For adobe XD\
\
first thing first (select the mobile size iPhone 6-7), select square and fill-in a white square in the mobile site, check for no borders open in adobe xd.  remember to select the pointer back because the square cursor is annoying.\
\
after you select the square you can dump the image on top, you might have to rezise the image to get it to fit.  The opacity bar is at the side you can slide that to make it less or more.  \
\
to select the grid you click on the title box (the mobile square, you can change the name too) and then you select square under grid and make it 15 square boxes.  \
\
Typeface - a particular design of type.  \
\
Use pointer to select the element and then hit backspace to delete it.  \
\
Right i just downloaded the BG bespoke font family to adobe xd.  \
\
This is how you do it.  Adobe xd is linked to the mac fonts on your computer, so if it is not in the mac it will not be in xd.  \
\
The font package is in the finder.  Double click opens it.  Look in the computer folder to see if it has your font, it might be there but not activated.  If it is not even there, you will have to download it.  \
\
You down load it form a website, i moved the zip file to the desktop section.  Then open up the font package in finder again.\
\
click the computer folder then in the menu bar up top click and scroll down to add font, it will open up your computer, locate the desktop and click  add, it might need some more validation from you and it will need admin privileges.  \
\
It should now be there in xd, it is not an xd problem it is mac problem if it is not there.  \
\
he uses the line tool for the hamburger menu.  \
\
command 1 gets you to 100% command 2 to 200%.  \
\
right click and you can make a symbol, which makes it easier for reuse, which i think will be very helpful.  So the pain might be in making it, but once you get it you can reuse the symbol again and again.  It is now called a component.  \
\
You can right click and add the colour to your assets too.  \
\
I see a little bit on the design here, british gas, is doing the nav background as white but then does the nav li as a grey background and then to get the illusion of the white on top for one of the list items it does it with a span element, going back to white.  \
\
It seems web design is essentially just little boxes, boxes stacked on boxes.  \
\
remember fa is the dev tools, font awesome icons.  \
\
finally got the font awesome icons to work on version 4.  \
\
Right the gym was really bad when i finished, it is a little bit better now, however the things i thought i did before are not working now or i am doing them incorrectly.  \
\
First, watch the weight lifted.  It seems the squat was ok at 80 kg but became sore at 90kg.  The compression seems to attack the bones - that shows you how big the compression forces are when you get older from the barbell squat.  \
\
Older lifters have said o go weight very very slowly.  \
\
after the squat when i get home, the arch is collapsed when further, so to protect the knee for the two days after training i must keep the orthotics in the slippers, just the prevent the knee from collapsing in.  \
\
The left leg is getting compression from the squat, i don\'92t think the compression is a killer but just watch.  My back seems to be in discomfort too.  To remedy this, think slight hip shift or pull down right away on the bar. \
\
Of course it could be other things like that dreadful goblet squat with those bad dumbbells put my left knee and back in an awful position, nearly caused an injury.  \
\
Take this easy and play it by ear.  next day prob be Tuesday.  neck is ok, just a little stiff.  I think that goblet squat cause most of the pain, although i can\'92t be so sure.  One thing to try is to take out the back exercises and see if that takes the back pain away. Also remember most old cunts have pain of some sort - maybe the best course of action is to ignore it? \
\
On to adobe xd tutoriel. Remember the artboard, the artboard is the way of making blank mobile screens to work on the next one.  \
\
Responsive resizing I think i need to know.  \
\
Over to right hand side it has responsive resize, this is to get the mobile design to look the same on the desktop size, i think this will be  great to show clients. \
\
When you have made a thing like the nav bar go over to responsive resizing and when you click manual in the arrows (up, down, left and right) you can choose to take one out so that it stays the same in the bigger screen.  Like for example take the height out.  So when you stretch it over in the next screen size the height will remain the same but the nav will stretch over, to promote consistency.  \
\
you can go over to the image in the html document and right click and say get in sources panel and then it will show you and then you can get the url address there and then take it.  \
\
sublime shortcut, command d to select the next tag or occurrence, this means i can change the whole tag too.  \
\
unordered lists have a margins and padding as standard.  \
\
learn more about flex grow tomorrow.  \
\
the clearfix only works with the parents div, not the childs.  \
\
the icons from font awesome seems to be using version 4.   I got the icon from that and  it seemed to work.  yeah it is 4.2 in their css folder.    \
\
they probably downloaded the kits from font awesome, that is why i can\'92t see it in the sources.\
\
svg\'92s are complicated bitches to colour.  Found a solution, first you have to make them inline in the html mark up, then apply the fill property like this, then you can apply the colour to the parent and the svg will inherit the color.  Like this;\
\
fill="currentColor"  \
\
\
Paul at universal credit, was going away with jet 2 away on the 8th for his pals 50th not now, made an appointment with me on the 7th, to catch up, to see if i have looked into the training aspect, getting that paid for.  The interview is going to be slightly longer.   he is off on annual leave, make sure he enjoys it.     \
\
Have a look at areas for growth.\
\
I don\'92t think you cannot padding in a svg, just the parent.  \
\
Ok when flexing the items below, if you have a svg, make sure you put divs as parents, because it will not flex properly.\
\
In fact, get into the habit of making a div for all svgs.    \
\
when you have display flex, if one of the items is a paragraph it will automatically get the most space, providing it is long than the other items of course, irrespective if it flex grow or not.  \
\
Ah i think background images and the img tag aren\'92t the same thing, it is not display block, height auto etc.  That is for inline html images.  \
\
Parent of the background image needs to have an explicit height value, no i don\'92t think it does now, it is just padding bottom or top \
\
So the trick is padding bottom or top.  \
\
Ok so I made a mistake but i think it made the markup far less.  If you have two images, one the major image and then an image decoration to make the first image look more appealing then what you do is in the mark up you wrap the second image div inside the first div, this is more for background images.  This means the two images share the same container really.  \
\
It is all in the padding top either bottom or top, it doesn\'92t matter, this is what makes the image responsive.  The boy i look at said the parent has to have a width set, i never found that.  All i needed was the background image mixin and the padding top property, no position absolute or relative, and no pseudo elements either.  \
\
if you add padding to the decoration image element inside the main background image element, then that will make your main image slightly bigger, but not too big to notice.  To move the decoration down to the bottom or top, we manipulate the transform property with the transformY axis.  Here i had to go to a whopping 272%!\
\
I don\'92\'92t know if you use set pixels for transform - maybe i should check that.  \
I think i found that you can just keep a lower padding in the first image to bring that into view, and then you can add more padding on the bottom image keeping the image looking good and a good size.  \
\
vertical align: top is good for footnotes to make the number top of the text.   I am going to just check this property now.  \
\
Ok played around with it, you have a lot of options, it will usually be for span tags.  \
\
display: inline for this.  \
\
it seems buttons do not inherit the font family - i will check that. Yeah that is correct, they do not inherit the body stuff, buttons are known as a form element and do not inherit the body stuff.   \
\
maybe i need a tutorial to design  nice buttons.   \
\
use indented fa\'92s so you know what belongs to what.  Because if you do it with the class the whole thing will change, all of the fa\'92s will change.    \
\
I learned a good thing there with position fixed and position sticky.  Position sticky keeps the flow of the markup but still allows you to scroll the menu down the page and return it to the top of the page.\
\
you still need the top and left and right positions to get it to span the whole page.  \
\
bottom seems less important, especially for fixed.\
\
With postiostion fixed the html markup is ignored and position fixed goes in accordance with the measurements of the html document element.  \
\
so if you do top: 0, left: 0, right: 0 and bottom: 0 it will span the whole page.  \
\
so take out the bottom: 0 as position fixed is relative to the html element, irrespective if you put position relative in a parent, it will just ignore that.  \
\
if you go with position fixed it has the advantage of going over the underneath sections as you scroll you scroll over them.  However as you pin the nav bar to the top because it goes out the flow of the mark up you will undoubtably have to give a margin-top value of the next section to get it to show on the page, otherwise the nav bar of portion fixed, will just go on top of it.  \
\
With position static you do not need to give a margin top of the next section group of elements.  The nav bar of position sticky retains the document flow, so bottom: 0 will just be the bottom of its height, not the whole page like portion fixed.  \
\
The disadvantage (if you could call it that, depends on preference) is that the nav bar  will not go on top of the underlining elements so when you do scroll you scroll from the position of , \'91seeing\'92 all the underneath content.  \
\
Now it depends what effect you want to have.  If you add a drop down menu to a portion sticky it means the markup all moves down when you display it, that may not be the effect you want, with British gas they want the drop down menu to go over the image, with that you need a position fixed. \
\
Ok trying to get transitions to work with javascript when it is display none.  \
\
This may be helpful in the future.  That was really annoying.  I was using a strange font that was only hosted at a certain website.  I used their CDN to access it, however i am thinking their available CDN\'92s are miles away from me, which resulted in my browser being very slow to load.   So any little change i was doing i had to wait an age to get right.  \
\
That was not on.  So if i am using a strange font that is not from google, then CDN\'92s might not be an option.  So in that case it is better to download it to my computer and use it locally.  \
\
To access this we use the, \'93@font-face\'94\
\
property where the two properties to mention are what the font-family is called and the src of the file to access\
\
to src the files, get the folder inside your working directory.  \
\
you can change the name of the directories to make it more accessible.  However just be aware to just change the main directory name and not the sub directory names, as that might bugger up the code if their inside files are sourcing the named subdirectories and you have changed the name.  \
\
I just put the changes in the typography section of the sass.  \
\
it now seems to load much quicker, thank god for that.  \
\
the formats to access these font files seem to vary from  TTF\'92s to which is truetype, to : open type to WOFF to SVG\'92s\
\
Ok i managed to get the effect I wanted.  The clue was with the british gas site, they use height.  The reason my height attempt was not giving me the desired effect was that i was toggling the original height with auto height.  Auto height does not have the desired effect with the transition.  I do not why, it just loads too quickly.  So what you have to do to see the effect you want you have to use an actual height, you can work that out with the computed section in the google developer tools.  I think i have settled on the header collapsing and expanding rather than the drop down menu container doing the same thing.  The reason being is that there is less css to input on the fly at the javascript end.  \
\
section height without the drop down menu = 115px so 11.5rem\
\
section height with drop down menu = 57rem.\
\
the transition works on the height property then.  \
\
The display none and display block i think can only be done with a set timeout to get the transitions in.  \
\
I am going to see if there is another way to do this code with the toggling the body tag.  \
\
Yeah i think this is a better solution, we still have to add and remove the event listeners.  However, by working with the body tag we get the whole document and we can keep the styling and the behaviour separate.  \
\
when doing the javascript, i tried to use DRY methods and all i think i need to do is query the header.  I might be able to shorten even still by using the class header and the event parameter.  we will see. \
\
watch the fixed overflow with the smaller screens. \
\
i need a media query at about 571 because the drop down list is getting cut off.\
\
I think we have to do a conditional when to say if the menu system gets clicked, turn off the my account menu. \
\
Right, so i have managed to get the two menus working when you click and don\'92t click the button the menus slide down and up respectively.  \
\
so what i need to do now is disable the click when the other is being pressed.  The logic i think would be the if statement.  \
\
if myAccount is clicked disable click event for my menu and vice versa.  Check if javascript can disable a click event.  \
\
You could use a css solution, in that if the click event is apparent with one of the menus, means the pointer events of the nav menu are none.  \
\
Lets see how i would do this.  The css solution is very clean and intuitive, however i would like to know the other solution.  \
\
I managed to do this, kind of scraped by.  \
I suppose i used the logic available to me.  The toggle function from javascript helps to speed up the process.  This way shorten the code considerably and i didn\'92t need to switch event listeners on and off i could just toggle a class and then it would be displayed or not displayed when clicking on the menu or not.  \
\
This brought me to my second logic and challenge.  I noticed through the dev tools that my classes were both avavliabe when toggling the menu buttons.  I thought i would have to go through adding and removing event listeners when clicking one menu system over another.  However i think that solution would be similar to pointer events none from the css.  \
\
So i remembered when we can\'92t toggle or when toggle is not the best option, we can add and remove classes.  So i thought while we are toggling the given menu that would it be possible to remove the other class?  I didn\'92t think it would work, but it does.  The logic that would make more sense to me would be to add one class and remove the other and vice versa.  \
\
Thankfully the toggle does work and it removes the other class if apparent.  If it is not apprante nothing happens which is cool too.  \
\
Do we need the behaviour from the other  body class now that javascript is removing the other class?  wouldn\'92t the transition still work because it would go to the original behaviour?  I think it will.\
\
Yes it does.  cool.  \
\
The covid section menu with the first blob of information is 88px height.  \
\
Ok that was annoying to say the least, i am finding flex box useful but pernickety.  Maybe check to see if grid is a better solution tomorrow.  \
\
However when you have a situation where you have three flex items as children and say two are icons or images and one is a paragraph.  \
\
By default flex: row in the container will align the items according to there width natutrally so if the two icons take up less space and the paragraph takes up more that will be shown as default.  However, i have noticed that to keep the three items perfectly aligned to the container, it is better under the flex items to align the biggest one to flex grow of 1 and the lesser two containers to flex grow of 0.  \
\
Ok now say i want to add more paragraphs in, if i don\'92t wrap the paragraphs in its own container the paragraphs willa some the display row format and align next to each other as there own separate flex item.  \

say you have 3 paragraphs you will now have a 5 column row (plus the two icons).  This is not ideal so to get around this we wrap the paragraphs in a container that makes the container the flex item and not the paragraphs.  So the paragraph will stack on top of each other as default html inside the container, whereas the contianer itself flex\'92s over to other side.  \
\
However what also became apprante is that the margins where screwed up when looking at the flex items.  The paragraph was too close to icon one and two far away from icon 3.  \
\
One way to sort this is that you can give the paragraph\'92s container its own padding however this seemed to become problematic for media queries and i foresee a lot of them with this solution as the space between icon one and three was stilll very far.  \
\
Strangly (according to my knowledge thus far) what worked or will give me less media query manipulation was  not to set a width of the paragraph container but put a width in the paragraphs themselves.  \
\
Ah i think this works or rather the width in the container paragraph doesn\'92t work is because it is a flex item the width is ignored under this setting.  Padding is not but width is.  \
\
So a way around this is to put a width on the children them seem not to be affected by the flex width restriction or rather its automatic working out.  \
\
You can also make children containers display flex as well which will make the paragraphs once again flex items.  Bizarre!!! lol. \
\
pointer events: none seems very useful when doing multiple drop down menu\'92s. \
